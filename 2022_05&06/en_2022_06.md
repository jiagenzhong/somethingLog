Some of these plants were grown in my greenhouse here in Maine.  
Propagating this way saves a lot of cost.  

These are called Birds of Paradise, Strelitzia reginae - a species of evergreen tropical herbaceous plant native to South Africa.

Behind the planted urn are the lush green kiwi vines growing on my home.  
Kiwi vines can tolerate a lot of different light conditions, but more exposure to sun brings out better colors in the leaves, some of which can be variegated.

In order to help the trees, the first step was to check the soil.  
Rocky says, "**never guess, always test.**"  
And he took many samples of soil from around the trees.  
Rocky's mantra is "if one takes the time to learn the language of the land, the soil will speak."  
Good quality, healthy soil is essential for plant growth.  
Soil is essential for plant growth.  
Soil helps regulate the water, supports biodiversity, filters pollutants, provides support, and cycles nutrients.

This was one of the first white peonies to open.  
...  
They are native to Asia, Europe, and Western North America.

Peonies are one of the best-known and most dearly loved perennials --- not surprising considering their beauty, trouble-free nature and longevity.  

Herbaceous peonies grow two to four feet tall with sturdy stems and blooms that can reach up to 10-inches wide.  
We spaced the plants about 3 to 4 feet apart to avoid any competing roots.  

...

The peony’s fragrance can vary, but most have sweet, clean scents.  
And, do you know… 
Pink peonies tend to have stronger fragrances than red peonies?  
Double from white peonies are also very aromatic.
