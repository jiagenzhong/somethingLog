### Subject: A New Chapter in the Fight & Still Celebrating Life

The day I got my first PET – scan results last September showing “possible cancer” I immediately jumped out the door and ran my first ever half-marathon.  
9 months later, when I got my PET-scan results confirming I am now Stage IV, I immediately ran out the door and ran my second ever half-marathon!  
Even after 14 miles, I never lost my breath – not too shabby for a guy with a couple of lung tumors hub? 😊  

Final medical plans haven't been decided yet but it looks likely that I will begin a pretty harsh chemo regimen in July after I get back from a much needed Michigan Family vacation.  
The great news is that it seems like my tumors are very slow growing, so if they respond to the chemo – between that & my overall great health, my doc thinks I could very well be a long term survivor in terms of prognosis – so no freaking out allowed J.  
That would be an incredible blessing – not only a lot more fun time with my two daughters in their childhood but also a lot more time for science to discover that CRC immunotherapy cure which many very smart scientists are working very hard on that right now!  
I am an eternal optimist when it comes to science!  
I also find Faith in the stage IV CRC patients (some of which I met directly) who have enjoyed miracle very long term complete remissions/cures – if it can happen to them, I see no reason to assume it can’t happen to me!  
I remain very optimistic!

Hi everyone,  
Well… This wasn’t an email I ever wanted to write - and I certainly did not plan to write to you all so soon after my last celebration email!  

I just revived the results from my latest PET-CT scan.  
My colon cancer has returned & I have been diagnosed Stage IV, with recurrence in both my lymph nodes as in my lungs.  
On one hand the diagnosis feels like an absurd surprise to me because feel 100% healthy but on the other hand, since they have been watching those enlarged nodes since last August, I’ve had months of mental preparation for this possibility.

放狗：（gdb how to print registers）

>...【Use e.g. p $rax to print value from a single register. In gdb, remember that access to a register is via $name instead of the more familiar %name . A register is treated as an untyped 8-byte value and when you ask gdb to print it, it shows a decimal integer or hex address.】...
