### Abstract

#### Purpose
The aim of this study was to determine the cumulative effect of a routine (hot-to-) cold shower on sickness, quality of life and work productivity.

#### Methods
Between January and March 2015,3018 participants between 18 and 65years without severe
comorbidity and no routine experience of cold showering were randomized(1:1:1:1) to a (hot-to-) coldshower for 30, 60, 90 seconds or a control group during 30 consecutive days followed by 60days of showering cold at their own discretionfor the intervention groups. The primary outcomewas illness days and related sickness absence from work.  
Secondary outcomes were quality of life, work productivity, anxiety, thermal sensation and adverse reactions.

#### Results
79% of participants in theinterventions groups completed the 30 consecutive days protocol.  
A negative binomial regression model showed a 29% reduction in sickness absence for (hot-to-) cold shower regimen compared to the control group (incident rate ratio: 0.71, P = 0.003).  
For illnessdays therewas no significant group effect.  
No related serious advents events werereported.

#### Conclusion
A routine(hot-to-) coldshower resultedina statistical reduction of self-reported sickness absencebut not illness days in adults withouts evere comorbidity.

### Introduction

Cold bathing is a common custom in many parts of the world.  
Ever since the introduction of civilized bathing, humans have experimented with water temperature variation to expose the body to extreme conditions.  
In ancient times, Roman bathing was based around the practice of moving through a series of heated rooms culminating in a cold plunge at the end.[1]  
In modern times, the traditional ritual of the frigidarium has been kept in most saunas and spas around the world.  
Cold bathing has been claimed to have multiple beneficial effects on health such as improvement of the immune system, cardiovascular circulation and vitality, but any true association remains unclear.[2]  
Previous investigations on the short-term effects of cold exposure have shown increases of cortisol and norepinephrine concentrations with modulation of the physiological response but showed minimal or no immune modulation.[3–7]  
However, the cumulative clinical effect and relevance for health after adaption of cold exposure (response conditioning) in healthy humans remain speculative as randomized controlled trials are lacking.  
The primary objective of this trial was to determine whether perceived illness could be modulated after repeated pragmatic cold exposure by taking a cold shower for at least 30 consecutive days.  
Secondary objectives were to determine whether there was any effect on quality of life, work productivity and anxiety as well as adverse reactions.  
A dose response relationship was investigated by varying in the duration of the cold shower.

### Methods

#### Study Design
This parallel group, unblinded, randomized controlled trial was designed following CONSORT guidelines and took place in The Netherlands, named the Cool Challenge.  
Between December 7th and December 30th 2014, we recruited participants through advertisements and (social) media.  
Inclusion, randomization and data collection were all performed via a web based application using surveys only.  Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.  
The study was designed as a pragmatic trial and compliance to the intervention could not be verified.  
The primary aim was to look at any effect of a routine cold shower and the secondary aim was to look at dose-dependency effects.  
The study protocol was approved by our institutional review board based on ethical considerations (September 3rd 2014, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).  
Being exempt from formal medical ethical review as it was considered non-medical research, this non-clinical trial was not registered in a clinical trial registry before recruitment of the first participant but on June 25th 2015 prior to data analysis (August 5th—September 13th 2015) with The Netherlands National Trial Register (NTR), approved by the WHO, number NTR5183.  
The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered.

#### Participants
Participants were adults aged 18–65 without routine experience of (hot-to-) cold showering who were employed when they entered the study.  
As no harmful effects of cold showering have previously been reported, the only exclusion criterion was significant comorbidity, including cardiac, pulmonary or any other severe disease.  
Exclusion criteria were primarily self-assessed.  
Significant comorbidity was defined by either a subject’s positive answer to the self-assessment question: “Do you have a severe medical condition to the heart or lungs?” or at investigator’s judgement of the subject’s self-reported medical conditions.  
Subjects were asked to answer the question: “Do you have a medical condition?” Careful screening was done for any severe cardiac, pulmonary or other systemic comorbidity at the investigator’s judgement.  
After informed consent, eligible participants were randomized to one of four groups (1:1:1:1).  
Randomization was performed using computerized random numbers within a custom-made Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) scripted web-based application for online surveys, without applying block randomization or stratification methods.  
The function RAND with PHP programming language was used, which assigns a random number between 1 and 4 each time.[8]  
Allocation concealment was ensured within the web-based application.  

#### Procedures
(略)

#### Outcomes
All outcomes were self-reported using web based surveys. The primary outcome was illness days and related leave from work during the 90-day study period (January to March 2015).  
Sickness absence was considered to be the most objective indirect parameter indicative of illness severity.  
Participants were asked to rate the total number of days of absence from their work due to sickness, if possible by verifying with their employer or their agenda. Absence frequency was not measured.  
Illness days were defined as the total amount of days a participant felt ill (including symptoms of cold and flu). Participants were asked to rate the number of days that they had “symptoms of illness, cold or flu” during the study period.  
If participants rated sickness absence or illness over five days, they were asked for a reason.  
The secondary outcomes were time of subjective sickness, quality of life, work productivity, thermal sensation
and anxiety.  

* Quality of life was assessed using the Short Form 36 (SF-36), a 36-item patient-reported survey of health.[10]  
Results were analyzed including the physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS), with higher scores representing better quality of life.  
The Dutch 4-week recall version was used, as adapted and validated by Aaronson et al.
[11]

* Work productivity was assessed using the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES), a 9-item survey with a 7-point Likert scale of engagement during work activities (0 = “never” to 6 = “every day”) and the total sum scores (range 0–54) were used for analysis, with higher scores representing better work productivity. [12–13]  

* Mediation of the mind-body neurosensory pathways were assessed as changes in daily thermal sensation of the body and extremities, respectively (expressed as warmer, colder or not different from their habitual daily sensation before the start of the trial).  

* To explore anxiety, we selected the six questions of the subscale scoring anxiety from the Brief Symptom Inventory.[14]  
The total anxiety score (range 0–24) of this self-report inventory with a 5-point Likert scale of distress (0 = "not at all" to 4 = "extremely") was used for analysis with lower scores representing less anxiety. The Dutch version was used, as adapted and validated by De Beurs and Zitman.[15]  

* At each follow-up moment, participants were asked to report any positive and negative effects. Adverse reactions other than influenza or influenza-related symptoms that were possibly or likely related to (hot-to-)cold showering were recorded by asking participants for any negative experiences and events as well as reasons to discontinue the intervention.

### Discussion
In this pragmatic randomized controlled trial, routinely showering (hot-to-) cold resulted in a 29% reduction of self-reported sick leave from work but not illness days at 90 days follow-up in adults without severe comorbidity. The contrast between the results of both primary outcome parameters is suggestive of the fact that the intensity rather than the duration of symptoms is modulated by the intervention.  
Regular physical activity resulted in a 35% reduction of sickness absence.  
The combination of routine (hot-to-) cold shower and regular physical activity resulted in an expected 54% reduction of sickness absence compared to people who don’t do either.  
The duration of the cold shower did not influence outcome as there was no significant difference between intervention groups. The only secondary outcome that showed a slight beneficial effect–on the short run–was quality of life (mental component summary) although this was deemed too small to be clinically relevant.  
**Even though the vast majority of participants reported a variable degree of discomfort during cold exposure, the fact that 91% of participants reported the will to continue such routine (and 64% actually did) is perhaps the most indicative of any health or work benefit. The most commonly reported beneficial effect was an increase in perceived energy levels (including many reported comparisons to the effect of caffeine).**  
The most common discomfortable related adverse reaction was persistent cold sensation in body, hands and/or feet in up to 13% of participants. Other related harmful effects were mild and uncommon.  

Influenza was the most common reason for participants’ absenteeism durations longer than five days. This study was performed during the 2014/2015 influenza epidemic in The Netherlands, which lasting a total of 21 weeks had the longest duration since more than 40 years.[17]  
The influenza-like illness incidence (consulting a general practitioner) was consistently above 10 per 10,000 inhabitants during the study period, with 5 per 10,000 inhabitants representing the threshold for a mild epidemic. An epidemic is defined as an incidence above this threshold for at least two consecutive weeks.  
The actual incidence of influenza cases was considerably higher, because only a proportion of the patients with influenza-like symptoms consulted the general practitioner. At the start of the season, influenza virus A(H3N2) dominated, while later in the season, influenza virus B was most prevalent.  
A part of the circulating influenza A-viruses appeared to mismatch with the influenza A-strain in the vaccine.  
Other prevalent viruses during the study period included the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the enterovirus
and the rhinovirus.

We searched PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews on Effects for articles published between Jan 1, 1980, and Oct 1, 2015 on the effect of any type of cold bathing on health. We used the broad MeSH term “Cold Temperature” in combination with the terms “bath” or “shower”.  
Our search resulted in no randomized controlled trials that assessed health. One Cochrane review investigated the effect of cold-water immersion for preventing and treating muscle soreness after exercise[18] and found some evidence that cold-water immersion reduces delayed onset muscle soreness after exercise.  
The three randomized controlled trials were limited to the subject of cold bathing on athletic performance[19,20] and physiological response.[3]  
Positive habituation effects on the physiological response and slight beneficial outcomes on athletic recovery have been reported.  
However, there is a lack of data regarding any cumulative clinical effect and relevance for health.

Cold water has been used therapeutically for many centuries and continues using modern technology.  
**Hippocrates, the father of medicine, who added rubbing to cold bathing, was accustomed to use cold water in his treatment of the most serious illnesses**.[21]  
Although most cold exposure studies involved cold water immersion, different methods of cold water therapy
such as cold bathing and cold showering are used interchangeably and seem to have similar effects.[19]  
**The latest form of cold therapy (or stimulation) is called whole-body cryotherapy and consists of exposure to very cold air that is maintained at -110°C to -140°C in special temperature-controlled cryochambers, generally for 2–3 minutes. It was initially proposed for the treatment of rheumatic diseases[22] but is increasingly popularized among athletes for its supposedly beneficial effect on recovery and performance, even though it has not been confirmed in a recent systematic review.**[18,23–24]  
In The Netherlands, there has been an increasing trend for cold bathing over the past few years.  
Part of this growing popularity is owed to the scientific approach of a health and mindset technique hallmarked by cold-exposure as created by an individual named Wim Hof, nicknamed the Iceman for his ability to remain constant body temperature in extreme cold conditions.[25]  
These methods involving concentration, breathing and cold-exposure have shown to modulate the immune response.[26] These findings served as inspiration to design the present trial and its popularity facilitated recruitment of over three thousand participants in just one month time.  
The mechanism or explanatory pathway of any therapeutic effects of cold exposure remains unclear.  
In the acute phase (during shivering) increases of cortisol and norepinephrine concentrations have been reported but resulted in minimal or no immune modulation.[4–7]  
Moreover, both immune-stimulatory and immune-inhibiting effects of cold exposure during exercise increase controversy.[27] Data obtained mainly on small mammals suggests that cold exposure suppresses several cellular and humoral components of the immune response but adaptation to a given cold stimulus appears to develop over the course of 2–3 weeks.[28]  
Beta-endorphin increase has been reported after cold exposure in rats and cold stress-induced modulation of cell immunity has been reported during acute Toxoplasma gondii infection in mice.  
[29–30] **However, these findings could not be reproduced in one study in humans.**[31]  
The current study adds data on cold adaptation following repeated cold exposure.  
Longterm hormonal and cytokine effects of such modulation are relatively small and its significance remains unclear as only the early steps of the immune cascade appear to be affected.[6]  
The fact that there was no difference between 30, 60 or 90 seconds of cold showering is consistent with previous research on the habituation of the initial responses to cold water immersion.  
**The greatest physiological response to cold water exposure was observed during the first 30 seconds and the rapidity suggests that it is initiated by neurogenic pathways rather than circulating hormones.**[32]

**Another physiological explanatory mechanism is the improvement of fitness level when considering the routine cold shower as frequent engaging physical activity.**  
In the present trial, reduction of sickness absence of a routine cold shower (29%) was comparable to the effect of regular physical activity (35%).  
A previous study in The Netherlands showed that the mean total duration of absenteeism was 15% lower in cyclists than in non-cyclists.  
Cycling to work was therefore associated with less sickness absence.[16]  
The more often people cycled to work and the longer the distance travelled, the less they reported sick.  
This is consistent with the findings of Nieman et al. who have shown in several studies that there is an inverse relationship between physical activity or fitness level and the rates of upper respiratory tract infection.[33]  
Recently, a meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials determined the effects of exercise on prevention of the common cold. The effect of exercise on the prevention of the common cold had a relative risk reduction of 27% and there was a mean reduction of 3.5 illness days compared to controls.[34]  
In addition, there are multiple psychological explanatory mechanisms such as expectancies which play a major role for the treatment outcome of a broad variety of immune-mediated conditions.[35]  
The outcome expectations of the present study billed as testing the hypothesis whether “cold-showers-might-decrease-illness-and-improve-health” could potentially play a suggestive role in the actual outcomes such as the decision to go to work when feeling ill.  
**The promotion material included more positive than negative general claims to be explored such as “Habitual cold exposure has been claimed to have positive influences including improvements of the immune system, circulation, emotional state, skin conditions, and energy.**  
The aim of this study is to investigate whether such claims are true.” Other than the statement of these unsupported claims, promotional material did not suggest that cold showers might reduce illness or absenteeism. Prior to the start of the trial, participants were informed of several outcome parameters including vitality, energy levels, work productivity and sickness absence.  
They were intentionally not informed of primary and secondary outcomes.  
Participants were fully aware of the four different groups.  
Other communication forms such as consent form and emails were nonsuggestive.  
The contrast between the results of both primary endpoints could also suggest that the intervention made participants more resilient to absenteeism with comparable intensity and duration of illness symptoms.  
Our data cannot determine whether the present findings were causal or associational.  
Moreover, participants in this trial could not be blinded for the intervention nor for their own outcome assessment, hence potentially introducing important bias.  
Specifically, a placebo-effect of this intervention cannot be ruled out. However, if such effect was causative in this trial, it should not be considered as an effect of an “inert substance”.[36]  
**Placebo effects rely on complex neurobiologic pathways involving neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine and activation of specific, quantifiable, and relevant areas of the brain.**[37]  
**With the recent discovery of the central nervous system lymphatic system represent, a neurobiologic immunostimulatory effect should not be ruled out.**[38]  
The findings of this study should be interpreted while accounting for its limitations.  
First, all outcomes were self-reported based on our online survey design.  
**Hence, none of our parameters could be objectified.**  
Our primary outcome sickness absence was selected for its closest proximity of an objective parameter.  
Second, according to the SF-36 data, the study population is extremely healthy compared the general Dutch opulation. 
This is most likely a correct measurement due to an important sampling bias: 
(1) all patients with severe comorbidity were excluded;  
(2) the athletic / strenuous character of the study attracted a highly motivated, healthy and physically active group with SF-36 averages much higher than the population norm though lower than a competitive athletic population;[39]  
(3) 96% of participants rated their health to be good or excellent;  
(4) the prevalence of participation in sports (85%) in the

study population was higher than the average norm (53% in the national population of 12 years and above);[40] and (5) average sickness absence in the control group (1,55%) was almost a third compared to the average sickness absence in the Dutch population (4,4% during the first quartile of 2015 corresponding to the study period).[41] Third, attrition bias could be introduced because of the large loss to follow-up (20%), which is likely due to the online-only interface of the study. Non-responders could only be contacted by the provided email address.  
In the intervention groups, large numbers of participants discontinued the intervention because of its burden or a sickness making them choose for their preferred routine.  
In contrast, in the control group discontinuers were much fewer as the control group instructions to shower as regular did not cause any burden or preference to discontinue due to sickness.  
Fourth, inherent to the pragmatic design, compliance to the intervention was not verifiable.  
Participants were asked to record if and how long they continued the intervention. During the first 30 days of the trial the median recorded time of the intervention was equal to the instructed time for each group, which is suggestive of valid measures for dividing the groups.  
During the last 60 days of the trial the median recorded time for the intervention was different only in the 90s cold shower group (median 60s, interquartile range 10–110).  
In our opinion there was no incentive to report false data considering the anonymous character of data analysis.   
Such bias would likely have a tendency to reduce any effect on health and work because of the limited compliance ranging from 64 to 79 percent of participants during the study period.  
Fifth, the relatively short follow-up period and the very healthy character of the study group resulted in the fact that most participants did not have any sickness absence days at all.  
Sixth, there was a variation of temperature of the coldest available shower water according to location. However, less cold temperatures would underestimate the effect of the intervention.  
The main strengths of this trial include its innovativity, the large number of participants, the randomization to four groups and the pragmatic approach in a domestic setting.  
It was designed as a straightforward study looking at cumulative subjective effect after a routine behavioral intervention in daily life and significant relevance in terms of effect size.  
This pragmatic randomized controlled trial is the first study showing that a routine cold shower has a beneficial effect on health.  
Repetitive cold showering can modulate the physiological response.[3]  
Our findings show that routinely showering (hot-to-) cold for at least 30 days resulted in a reduction of self-reported sick leave from work but not illness days in adults without severe comorbidity.  
Further research using objective parameters is necessary to determine whether these were causal or associational findings. Considering the mild effect of a routine cold shower on hormonal and cytokine modulation, these alone are unlikely to play a significant role.[4–7] Perhaps neuroimaging technologies such as functional MRI could be used to assess any potential neurobiologic immunostimulatory effect.

### Abstract
To differentiate between the effect of cold and hydrostatic pressure on hormone and cardiovascular functions of man, a group of young men was examined during 1-h head-out immersions in water of different temperatures ($32^{\circ}C,20^{\circ}C,14^{\circ}C $).

Immersion in water at $32^{\circ}C$ did not change rectal temperature and metabolic rate,  
but lowered heart rate ($15^{\circ}C$) and systolic and diastolic blood pressures (by $11^{\circ}C$. or $12^{\circ}C$, respectively),  
compared to controls at ambient air temperature.  
…  
Immersion at $20^{\circ}C$ induced a similar decrease in plasma renin activity, heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressures as immersion at thermoneutrality, in spite of lowered rectal temperature and an increased metabolic rate by 93%.  
…  
No significant differences in changes in diuresis, plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration compared to subjects immersed to $32^{\circ}C$ were observed.  
Cold water immersion ($14^{\circ}C$) lowered rectal temperature and increased metabolic rate (by $350^{\circ}C$), heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (by 5%, 7%, and 8%, respectively).  
Changes in plasma renin activity were not related to changes in aldosterone concentrations.  
Immersion in water of different temperatures did not increase blood concentrations of cortisol.  
There was no correlation between changes in rectal temperature and changes in hormone production.  
Our data supported the hypothesis that physiological change induced by water immersion are mediated by humoral control mechanisms, while responses induced by cold are mainly due to increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system.

### Introduction
Immersion in cold water may exert its influence on the human body by both stimulation of baro -and cold receptors and by activation of the sympathetic nervous system and endocrine function.
These responses may in turn influence mechanisms controlling cardiovascular function and water balance.  

It has been shown repeatedly that immersion into thermoneutral water increases central blood volume(Arborelius et al. 1972; Epstein et al. 1981), mean stroke volume and, consequently, mean cardiac output, whereas systemic vascular resistance has been shown to decrease (Arborelius et al. 1972; Echt et al. 1974).  
Changes in blood pressure induced by immersion are not uniform.  
…  
An examination of the relationships between PRA and plasma aldosterone concentration has disclosed a striking parallel.  
It has been suggested that stimulation of the left atrial baroreceptors may also modulate renal output, also that left atrial distension and stimulation of cardiopulmonary baroreceptors during thermoneutral water immersion (Henry - Gauer reflex) may induce a decrease of activity in the sympathetic nervous system, which in part may also contribute to the increased diuresis and natriuresis (Behn et al. 1969; Kaiser et al. 1969; Galbo et al. 1979).  
Epstein et al. (1983) have shown that water immersion fails to alter plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline concentrations, while Krishna et al. (1983) have demonstrated a decrease in plasma noradrenaline concentration.  
Furthermore, Coruzzi et al. (1986) have concluded that the dopaminergic system constitutes an important determinant of the natriuretic response to water immersion.  
Various aspects of physiological responses to immersion in water at thermoneutral temperatures have been reviewed recently (Epstein 1992).
All the above mentioned experiments were performed on humans immersed in water at thermoneutral temperatures. Only few data are available on humans immersed in cold water.  
Keatinge and Evans (1961) have reported changes in activity of the cardiovascular system and Johnson et al. (1977) and Jansky¬ et al. (1996) have examined changes in catecholamine production.  
No attempt has been made to distinguish between responses induced by activation of baro-, or cold receptors.
Therefore, this study was performed to investigate cardiovascular and hormone changes during 1-h head-out immersion of young men in water at temperatures of $32^{\circ}C,20^{\circ}C,14^{\circ}C $

### Methods
（略）

### Results
Immersions into $32^{\circ}C$ water did not change rectal temperature and metabolic rate significantly (Fig. 1).  
...  
Immersion at $20^{\circ}C$ lowered heart rate (P=0.001)and both systolic and diastolic blood pressures, as during immersion at thermoneutrality, in spite of a lowering of rectal body temperature [省略] and a stimulation of met-
abolic rate by about 93% (P=0.01).  
...  
Cold water immersion ($14^{\circ}C$) lowered rectal temperature from 37.3 (SD 0.32) to 35.6 (SD 0.19)$^{\circ}C$ and increased metabolic rate by about 350%.  
...  
It was evident that a 1-h head-out immersion in thermoneutral water lowered heart rate and systolic and
diastolic pressures, while leaving rectal temperature and metabolic rate unchanged.  
Vasomotor changes occurred within the first 10 min of immersion and then became stabilised during the remainder of the immersion.  
In contrast to immersion in thermoneutral water, immersion in 20∞C water lowered rectal temperature, raised
metabolic rate slightly, but maintained lowered heart rate and blood pressures.
The data also indicated that 1-h immersion in cold water ($14^{\circ}C$) decreased body temperature by about $1.7^{\circ}C$, which induced a stimulation of thermogenesis and activation of the sympathetic nervous system, as evident from the increased noradrenaline concentrations.  
In accordance with the increased production of noradrenaline, heart rate and blood pressured increased,
when compared with subjects immersed in thermoneutral water.  
Water immersion was always accompanied by an increased diuresis, which was potentiated by cold.  
This was reflected in a decreased PRA.  
A decrease in PRA was accompanied by a decrease in aldosterone concentration at thermoneutral temperatures only.  
Cortisol production was not influenced either by water immersion at neutral temperatures or by cold, but rather tended to decrease during all exposures.  
The changes in diuresis and PRA were probably due to the effect of hydrostatic pressure during immersion rather than to the effect of cold.  
Metabolic rate and activity of the sympathetic nervous system were stimulated by cold rather than by water immersion.  
Cardiovascular functions were affected both by cold and water immersion, but in opposing ways.  
Intense cold stimuli increased heart rate and blood pressure, while thermoneutral water immersion induced bradycardia and decreased blood pressure.  
Part of the increase in heart rate may however, have been due to shivering rather than due to cold per se.

### Discussion
To our knowledge no previous attempt has been made to compare the effect of immersion in differing water temperatures on cardiovascular responses and hormone production of humans at rest.  
It should be taken into consideration, however, that immersion in $14^{\circ}C$ water
induced shivering, which could be considered as light exercise.  
Several experiments have been performed on subjects exercising in water at different temperatures (Christie et al. 1990; Connelly et al. 1990; Galbo et al.1979).  
_**Data presented in our paper would suggest that water immersion at neutral temperatures, which would stimulate mainly baroreceptors, and cold exposure, which would stimulate mainly thermoreceptors, activate different regulatory systems and different effector mechanisms.**_  
_**Thermoneutral water immersion induced bradycardia and decreased blood pressure, while strong cold stimuli increased heart rate and blood pressure.**_  
Since an increased concentration of noradrenaline in cold immersed subjects was also observed in this study,
it is tempting to conclude that immersion in thermoneutral water relatively strengthened the influence of the parasympathetic nervous system, while immersion in cold water overcame this effect by increasing the sympathetic tone.  
These findings have been supported by data in the literature documenting unaltered (Epsteinet al. 1983; Weihl et al. 1981), or even decreased (Norsk et al. 1990) plasma noradrenaline concentrations during immersion at thermoneutrality and increased concentrations of this substance during cold water immersions(Buhring and Spes 1979; Hiramatsu et al. 1984; Jansky-et al. 1996; Johnson et al. 1977; Weiss et al. 1988).

Data in the literature have also indicated that plasma adrenaline concentrations were lowered, while plasma dopamine concentrations were increased during cold exposure (Keatinge and Evans 1961; Weiss et al. 1988).  
We also found that plasma concentration of dopamine was significantly elevated during cold water immersion,
while the adrenaline concentration was unchanged.  
Thus, cardiovascular changes and a part of the metabolic increase in the cold (nonshivering thermogenesis Janskyet al. 1997) contributes to the increased production of noradrenaline and dopamine.  
Changes in cardiovascular functions due to cold water immersion have been discussed in detail in an earlier paper (Janskyet al. 1996).  
It was concluded that an increase in stroke volume may be the reason for the relatively small increase in heart rate in cold immersed subjects.  
In accordance with data in the literature (Epsteinet al. 1975; Epstein and Saruta 1971; Nakamitsu et al. 1994), the present study also showed that thermoneutral water immersion decreased PRA and increases diuresis.  
This may be due to an activation of renal baroreceptors by increased splanchnic blood flow as a consequence of an increase in hydrostatic pressure.  
The renal baroreceptor mechanism has been suggested to involve stretch-sensitive cells in the arterial wall, which may inhibit renin release when renal perfusion pressure increases (Skoott and Jenssen 1993).  
Diuresis was further potentiated by cold, while the decrease in PRA was independent of water temperature.  
The observed decline in PRA does not fully agree with data of Wittert et al. (1992), who have found an increase in PRA 30 min after exposure to cold air ($4^{\circ}$).  
No change in lowered PRA, observed in our study on cold exposed subjects, is in contrast with the known effect of sympathetic tone on renin release (see Gordon et al.1967).  
These findings are difficult to interpret.  
The explanation could be that activation of baroreceptors by an increased splanchnic volume is a very strong stimulus which is able to prevent the action of catecholamines on PRA release.  
Low PRA during cold immersion may also be due to an increased plasma concentration of dopamine.  
It has been found that the proximal tubules in the kidney can decarboxylate circulating L-DOPA, producing dopamine, and that activation of dopamine production reduces PRA in humans (Keeton and Cambell 1980).  
Also it has been shown that an increase of atrial natriuretic peptide can inhibit renin secretion (Skoott and Jenssen 1993).  
_**This suggestion has bee supported by our finding of a twofold increase in natriuresis during cold immersion (Sœramek et al. 1993).**_  
In accordance with data in the literature, our results would indicate that aldosterone concentrations were slightly decreased in water at $32^{\circ}C$, unchanged in water at $20^{\circ}C$, but slightly increased in water at $14^{\circ}C$.  
Hiramatsu et al. (1984) have also found increased aldosterone and cortisol concentrations in subjects exposed to moderate cold ($4^{\circ}C$ for 10 min) or severe cold (immersion of hands to $0^{\circ}C$ for 10 min).
The reasons why the lowered PRA did not inhibit aldosterone production and, vice versa, why increased aldosterone production in cold water was not reflected by changes in PRA, are not clear. Evidently, there exist several mechanisms controlling aldosterone production, besides the renin±angiotensin system.   
One possibility is that the increase in plasma aldosterone concentrations in the cold may have been due to stress-induced adrenocoticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion as has been suggested by Himathongham et al. (1975).  
Wittert et al.(1992), however, have observed no significant increase in plasma ACTH concentration in response to cold air($4^{\circ}C$ for 30 min) and a significant fall in plasma cortisol concentrations during the first 15 min of exposure.    
Our unpublished results have indicated that ACTH production is lowered in cold immersed subjects (Sœ ramek, unpublished).  
In our previous study (Sramek et al. 1993) we have observed a significant increase in plasma potassium concentration during cold water immersion, which may also have contributed to the increased aldosterone production as suggested by Himathongham et al. (1975).

Our observation that cortisol concentration decreased both during immersion in thermoneutral and in cold water seems to be in contrast to the common view that environmental stresses stimulate activity of the pituitary ± adrenal axis.  
This finding is in agreement with data of Leppaluoto et al. (1988), however, who have also demonstrated a significant fall in serum cortisol concentration in subjects exposed to cold air ($10^{\circ}C$) for 2h.  
_**The observed small decrease of plasma cortisol concentration was likely to have been due to the normal diurnal rhythm in cortisol production, because at no time was there any significant difference between values at rest and those after immersion in either cold or thermoneutral water.**_  
On the other hand, Wilson et al.(1970) have not found a diurnal decrease of plasma cortisol concentrations after a 3-h cold exposure to air temperatures of )5 to +2 $^{\circ}C$.  
Their experiment was performed in the late afternoon, while we exposed out subjects to cold water in the morning.  
The reason why the values of cortisol concentrations in subjects exposed to 14∞C water are slightly higher than in those exposed to other temperatures is not clear.  
_**In conclusion, as was evident from the cortisol concentrations, water immersions and cold did not induce activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-corticoadrenal axis, which typically occurs in subjects under stress conditions.**_  
Immersions inhibited PRA, while increasing aldosterone concentration.  
On the other hand, cold activated the sympathetic nervous system, enhancing dopamine and noradrenaline concentration.  
This was reflected in changes in vasomotor activity, heat production, diuresis and in distribution of body fluids.  
_**We would suggest that cold lowers aldosterone concentrations, but does not influence PRA.**_
