If you have some free time this weekend it’s never too early to start planning and prepping for the holiday season.

Recently on QVC, we celebrated "Christmas in July" with some of my newest decorations.  
I hope you were able to catch some of my appearances - I was on from early morning to late at night, joining LIVE right from my Bedford, New York farm talking with various hosts about my festive ornaments, figures, candles, tabletop trees, wines, and of course, the day's TSV - my Color Change Globe Light Strands.  
My entire home studio living room was lit up and filled with cheerful lights and pieces.  

Enjoy these photos, and be sure to take a look at all my holiday offerings on the QVC website.  

Here I am in my studio living room surrounded by lots of my newest holiday items for QVC.  
**We spent an entire day – 24-hours – celebrating my Collection. ** 
**It’s a lot of work, but always fun.**  

**Our tree looks so pretty this year.**  
**Look at all the glistening ornaments.**  
As part of my Collection, I am offering 13-piece Tree Decor Kits – complete with stars, wreaths, beaded birds, and metallic bursts.  
Buy one set, two, or even three and use them on your own tree or give away as gifts.  

Here is one of the beaded stars included in the kit.  

And here is one of the metallic bursts – they really do brighten up the tree and add a nice variety of decorations all in one group.  

This season, one can also get a set of six of these Metallic Feathered Birds with clips.  
As many of you know, I love birds, and these make such a nice addition to the holiday decor.  
**They come in silver or gold.**  

On my mantel are my Glittered Leaf Flower Lights.  
These lights come in six-foot long strands.  

**They can run for 266 hours and have a multi-function timer.**  

I decorated the mantel with my lights, flocked trees, and my popular flameless candles.  

This is my 16-inch Down Swept Flocked Tabletop Tree with 30 battery-operated LED lights.  
Place it on the mantel, bookcase, or table and decorate it with clip-on birds.

Everyone loves these Cable Knit Flameless Candle Pillars.  
**These are ivory, but they also come in Bedford gray and red.**

I also offer sets of two Glittered Holiday Tree Pillars in six-inch and nine-inch sizes.  
**These are white, but they also come in silver, champagne, and gold.**  
And they run on a multi-timer remote control.  

These birds come in a set of six and are made of blown glass on easy to use clips.  
**They look so pretty perching on your holiday tree branches.**  

Use my Jingle Bell Star Ornaments as part of your gift decor – attach to the bow and make them even more special.  

And the day’s TSV is my Color Change Globe Light Strands in silver or gold.  
I have them all over the room.

On my windowsill are these cheerful flat jeweled pedestal trees which can be swept up or down for display.  
And look, my TSV Color Change Globe Lights can be positioned around the base of the trees for a more festive effect.  

My TSV lights can also be mixed with holiday ornaments and placed in a cloche – look how festive they are.

**Drape the lights on your logs when the fireplace is not being used.**  
**It adds a beautiful look, especially at night.**  

This is one of a pair of Tinsel Fur Penguins.  
My Color Change Globe Lights look so fanciful used as a necklace.  

Place the pair on pedestals – a large one looks up as the other smaller penguin looks down.  

And don’t forget the wine.  
Order this for yourself or give as a gift.  
This wine set includes a choice of three 750-ml bottles of wine and three gift bags.  
The wine selections are Spencer Family Sauvignon Blanc, Bayshore Pinot Grigio, Monarch Glen Merlot, and Sierra Trails Zinfandel.  

And, because it’s “Christmas in July” – why not light up some beautiful summer roses?  
**Place them around the smaller vase containing the flowers, and then put in a larger glass vessel.** **These lights can be used in so many different ways in any season.**  
**We had so much fun talking about these holiday decorations.**  
**I hope you visit the website to see more of my new offerings.**  
It may be July now, but the holidays will be here before you know it.
