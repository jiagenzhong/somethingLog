* From:【[My Pergola Garden in SummerMy Pergola Garden in Summer](https://www.themarthablog.com/2022/07/my-pergola-garden-in-summer.html)】

> **Note**  
> The following is copied and pasted.  

**My long and winding pergola is full of striking orange-colored tiger lily blooms.**  

This pergola, located on one side of a carriage road near my Tenant House, goes through several transformations during the year.  
In late spring, a palette of bold purple and white alliums covers the area, followed by the delicate shades of lavender and blue from the flowering clematis vines that wrap around each of the granite posts.  
**Now, hundreds of brightly spotted tiger lilies line the garden bed for all to see --- and they are thriving.**  

Enjoy these photos.

**Tiger lilies, Lilium lancifolium, bloom in mid to late summer, are easy to grow and come back year after year.**  

**Native to China and Japan, these robust flowers add striking beauty to any border.**  
**I love how they look with their bright and showy orange colored blooms.**  

In early spring, this garden is filled with bold green stems of new growth.  

**By late May, this pergola garden is filled with lots of blue and purple flowers.**  
**This palette of colors is a big favorite at the farm --- it grows more colorful and vibrant every spring.**  

**In early June, the granite posts are filled with gorgeous clematis flowers.**  

**And then the entire garden goes through another dramatic transformation in summer.**  
**Here it is now --- bursting with gorgeous orange.**  
**This side of my long pergola is one of the first areas I see when I drive into my property.**  
**This pergola has thousands of waist-to-shoulder-high lilies.**  

**Tiger lilies are covered with black or deep crimson spots, giving the appearance of the skin of a tiger.**  
**They have large, down-facing flowers, each with six recurved petals.**  
**Many flowers can be up to five inches in diameter.**  

Lilies are well-known for having heavily pollinated stamens, which stain.  
Here, it is easy to see those pollen-filled anthers.  
When cutting, always remove the anthers to prevent a clothing disaster --- just pinch them off with gloved fingers.  

The blackish, round “seeds” that develop in the axils of the leaves along the main stem are called bulbils.  

The leaves can grow to three inches long and about 3/4-inch wide.  
They are medium green, narrow, smooth along their margins, and glabrous, clasping the stem at their bases.  

There are also a few white lilies in this bed --- adding more interest to the long floral display.

**And some lighter orange lilies.**

And there are still more lilies that have yet to open.

In various spots along the pergola garden are some of the dried alliums which I leave through the season.  

In this garden, we also have pops of daylilies.  
**The daylily is a low-maintenance perennial—easy to grow, virtually disease and pest free, and able to survive drought, uneven sunlight, and poor soil.**  
The daylily’s botanical name, Hemerocallis, comes from Greek hemera “day” and kallos meaning “beauty”.  
The name is appropriate, since each flower lasts only one day.  
Despite their name, daylilies are not “true lilies.”  
Leaves grow from a crown and the flowers form on leafless stems called “scapes,” which rise above the foliage.  

**On the granite posts, there are a few lasting clematis flowers.**  
**I have always loved clematis, and over the years I have grown many varieties of this wonderful plant.**  
**When well-maintained, clematis can bloom profusely from early summer to early fall.**  

There are a few bell-shaped clematis flowers that are still going strong too.  
**These have slightly fragrant blooms.**  

Not far from the pergola is this giant weeping copper beech tree --- **I love these trees with their gorgeous forms and rich color.**  
I have several large specimens on the property.  
On this afternoon, the clouds were also rolling in ------ look at the sky.  
**Unfortunately, rain did not follow.**  

And across the “soccer field,” where my grandson Truman loves to play when he visits, are six matched standard weeping hornbeams, Carpinus betulus ‘Pendula’.  
Weeping hornbeams can grow to be about 50-feet tall at maturity, with a spread of 40-feet.  
**These are very rare and precious trees and I am so happy they continue to thrive here.**  

**On the other side, across the carriage road --- a stand of stately bald cypress trees, now full of gorgeous soft green needle-like foliage.**  

In front of the tiger lilies is a border of boxwood shrubs I grew from cuttings.  
They’ve developed and grown into nicely sized specimens.  
Buxus is a genus of at least 70-species in the family Buxaceae.  
There are more than 300 boxwood shrubs planted on both sides of the pergola.  

**The entire pergola border and its surrounding gardens, trees, and other specimens provide a spectacular show every summer.**  
Straight ahead is my perennial flower cutting garden --- also filled with beautiful lilies this time of year.  
**All the gardens are looking spectacular, but here in Bedford, New York, we’re still waiting for some much needed rain.**  
**I hope we get some soon.**

* From:【[A July Garden Tour at Skylands](https://www.themarthablog.com/2022/07/a-july-garden-tour-at-skylands.html)】

> **Note**  
> The following is copied and pasted.  

**As many of you know, every now and then I enjoy opening my gardens for private walking tours at both my Bedford, New York farm and at my beloved home in Seal Harbor, Maine.**  

Last week, I hosted a summer walk at Skylands for the Decorative Arts Trust --- **a non-profit organization that focuses on promoting and fostering the appreciation and study of the decorative arts.**  
**Unfortunately I was not able to join the tour, but my gardeners, Mike Harding and Wendy Norling, guided the group of 30 through the wooded paths, sunny terraces, and gardens.**  

**Cheryl DuLong and Wendy keep me updated by taking photographs, enjoy.**  

Before the tour began, Wendy took this photo looking down from Terrace 1 to the large “cracked ice” terrace below.  
**This time of year, everything is so lush and green.**  

**This group included members from across the country.**  
They were all on a multiple day tour of several homes and gardens in the area known for its amazing Gilded Age architecture. **Here they are gathering in front of Skylands.**  

**This guest was in awe at the beautiful tall evergreens seen from my driveway.**  

This center garden in the driveway is planted with hay-scented ferns, which turn yellow in fall, purple smoke bushes, and spruce trees, Picea orientalis ‘Skylands’.  
**When I found these trees, I got many to plant here in Maine.**  

The tour brings guests up the steps from the guest house to my main house.  
**The rocks on the outside of the stone steps toward the top are called “Rockefeller’s Teeth” --- large blocks that serve as guardrails.**  
**These stone steps are cut roughly and spaced irregularly to create a rustic appearance.**  

Ferns are members of a group of vascular plants that reproduce via spores and have neither seeds nor flowers.  
The exterior of Skylands abounds with naturalized ferns of many types.  

This rhododendron near one of my natural pools begins to bloom in July with gorgeous pale pink and white flowers.

**Look at its blooms.**  
**Rhododendrons are prized for these big, showy flower clusters and the glossy green foliage.**  

**This part of the woodland is filled with beautiful moss.**  
Mosses are small, non-vascular flowerless plants that typically form dense green clumps or mats, often in damp or shady locations.  

**And here’s a view that never gets tiring.**  
Taken through the woods, this view looks out to Seal Harbor and the Cranberry Isles beyond.  

**Here’s my gardener Mike Harding speaking with one of the members about the plants that thrive at Skylands.**  

**The wild blueberries here in Maine are some of the sweetest --- and they’re ready for picking.**

Here’s a view of the wall ledge with “Rockefeller’s Teeth” at the top.  

**This look shows Seal Harbor with Sutton Island in the distance.**  

**On my large terrace, all the gorgeous potted plants are doing so wonderfully since we planted them in May.**  

Here is the sphinx “guarding” the terrace for the season.  
**She is one of two glazed terra-cotta sphinxes designed by Emile Muller.**  
Émile first used plain ceramic products on buildings and industries.  
**Then, in 1884 he developed the glazed terra-cotta, which he continued to use for many architectural decorations and art reproductions.**  
**These ladies are stored indoors and taken out as soon as the warmer weather arrives.**  

**Behind her, just some of the many lilies blooming in the terrace garden.**  
Lilium is a genus of herbaceous flowering plants that grow from bulbs, all with large prominent flowers.  
The beautiful blooms can be enjoyed as cut flowers in an arrangement or growing in the garden --- some at two feet, and others as tall as eight feet.  
I have been growing them for years --- Asiatic, Martagon, Candidum, American, Longiflorum, Trumpet and Aurelian, Oriental, and various interdivisional hybrids.

**These succulents are planted in a long stone trough I bought several years ago from Trade Secrets.**  
**Notice the pink gravel used to top the soil surrounding these plants --- it is the same pink gravel that covers the carriage roads at Skylands.**

This view is from my guest house looking through the trees onto the harbor.  
If one looks closely, my boat, Skylands II is out there secured to its summer moorings.

**And here’s a group photo taken on my terrace.**  
**This day was warm, but so perfect for a tour at Skylands.**  
**I am glad everyone enjoyed their visit.**

* From:【[Harvesting Summer Vegetables from My Garden](https://www.themarthablog.com/2022/07/harvesting-summer-vegetables-from-my-garden.html)】


> **Note**  
> The following is copied and pasted.  

**Here at my Bedford, New York farm, we're picking lots of wonderful and nutritious vegetables from the garden.**

**Earlier this week, my housekeepers Enma Sandoval and Elvira Rojas harvested a bounty of beautiful vegetables --- beans, artichokes, peppers, Swiss chard, cauliflower, cabbage, kale, and more.**  
**While the heat has affected some of the cold-weather vegetables, others are thriving.**  

Here are some photos.  

**There has been so much growth in this vegetable garden in the last couple of weeks.**  
Many of you ask what I do with all these vegetables.  
**I share most of them with my daughter, Alexis, and her children, Jude and Truman --- they love all vegetables.**  
**I also serve them at my dinner parties and share them with my friends and staff here at Bedford.**  
**And, I use them for various media shoots whenever needed, or when we test recipes here at the farm.**  
Nothing is ever wasted --- whatever isn’t used goes to my chickens, geese, and peafowl.  

**One can harvest any time of day, but when possible, the best picking time is early morning, when the sun is just clearing the eastern horizon and greens are still cool and dew-covered from the previous night.**  
**Here’s Elvira picking some of the peppers.**  

Sweet peppers, such as these banana peppers, have a long shape that tapers down to one to three lobes at the bottom.  
**We have so many peppers growing.**  

**The cauliflower also looks great.**  
**Cauliflower is filled with nutrients.**  
**They hold plenty of vitamins, such as C, B, and K.**  
**Cauliflower is ready to harvest when the heads are six to eight inches in diameter.**  
When picking, cut the stalk just below the head, leaving a stem of about two inches long.  

**The right time for cabbage harvesting will depend on the variety of cabbage planted and when the heads mature.**  
Look for heads that are firm all the way through when squeezed --- that’s when they’re ready.  

**Red, or purple, cabbage is often used raw for salads and coleslaw.**  
It contains 10-times more vitamin-A and twice as much iron as green cabbage.  
**We picked several heads of cabbage.**  

Look at our bed of kale --- very pretty with ruffled leaves and the purple and green colors.  
Kale or leaf cabbage is a group of vegetable cultivars within the plant species Brassica oleracea. Notice, the central leaves do not form a head.  

**Kohlrabi, also called German turnip, is a biennial vegetable --- a low, stout cultivar of wild cabbage.**  
White kohlrabi bulbs have a neutral, sweet, and subtly peppery flavor close to broccoli, turnips, or cabbage, but bulbs are much milder.  
**The leaves and stems are also edible and have a taste similar to collard greens or kale.**  

You can find green, purple, white, and even blue fleshed kohlrabi.  
**Typically found at farmers markets, purple kohlrabi is favored for its crunchy texture and sweet flavor, utilized in both raw and cooked dishes.**  

**Under the leaves in this area are the edamame beans --- whole, immature soybeans, sometimes referred to as vegetable-type soybeans.**  
They are green and differ in color from regular soybeans, which are typically light brown, tan, or beige.  

**Elvira also picked beans.**  
**Beans grow best in full sun and moist soil.**  
**Bush beans are second only to tomatoes as the most popular vegetables in home gardens.**  
Bush beans, or snap beans, are eaten when the seeds are small.  
They are also called string beans because of a fibrous string running the length of the pod.  
**Purple beans are so pretty --- violet-purple outside and bright green inside with great flavor.**  

These yellow beans are also pretty.  
**Bush beans grow on shrubby plants and are very prolific producers.**  
**They can continually produce throughout the season with the proper care.**  
**In general, bush beans should be ready in 50 to 55 days.**  

**And here, the green colored beans are also ready for picking.**  

**Everything is collected in buckets or large bowls like these and then brought up to my flower room, where they are washed if needed, then bagged and stored in the refrigerator.**  
**I am looking forward to many meals with all this wonderful produce.**  

Swiss chard always stands out in the garden, with its rich red stalks.  
**Swiss chard is a leafy green vegetable often used in Mediterranean cooking.**  
**The leaf stalks are large and vary in color, usually white, yellow, or red.**  
**The leaf blade can be green or reddish in color.**  
Harvest Swiss chard when the leaves are tender and big enough to eat.  

**We’re always growing lettuce.**  
Lettuce, Lactuca sativa, is a cultivated plant of the daisy family, Asteraceae.  
**Lettuce is a fairly hardy, cool-weather vegetable that thrives when the average daily temperature is between 60 and 70-degrees Fahrenheit.**  
**We always grow several varieties.**  

**Lettuces can generally be placed in one of four categories**:  
looseleaf, butterhead, crisphead, and romaine.  

**We planted more than 100-tomato plants this year.**  
**All the plants are now well-supported by bamboo stakes.**  
We’re growing both hybrid and heirloom varieties.  
**There are already so many fruits growing, but they need a little more time before harvesting.**  

**Sweet bell peppers are popular in the garden --- all grassy in flavor and super-crunchy in texture.**  
**I love making stuffed peppers --- so easy and so delicious.**  
**Enma wipes them down before putting them in the fridge.**  
**I’ll wash them just before cooking.**  

She does them same for these peppers.  
**Be careful when picking peppers --- always keep the hot ones separated from the sweet ones, so there is no surprise in the kitchen.**  

Here’s a bowl of garden fresh artichokes.  
I love artichokes.  
**We have many growing! ** 
**Artichokes are actually flower buds, which are eaten when they are tender.**  
Buds are generally harvested once they reach full size, just before the bracts begin to spread open.  
When harvesting, cut the stem approximately one to three inches from the base of the bud.  
The stem becomes a useful handle when trimming the artichoke.  


And look!  
**Our first bounty of fresh, organic peaches from my orchard!!**  
**We have so many fruits growing this season --- so sweet and delicious!**

* From:【[Bathing My Chow Chows, Empress Qin and Emperor Han](https://www.themarthablog.com/2022/07/bathing-my-chow-chows-empress-qin-and-emperor-han.html)】

> **Note**  
> The following is copied and pasted.  

It's bath time for my Chow Chows.

**My dogs are groomed and checked for ticks and fleas every day.**  
I have always been a firm believer in regular brushing and bathing --- every couple weeks for the dogs, and about once a month for my cats.  
**Yesterday was bath time for my gorgeous Chow Chows, Empress Qin and Emperor Han.**  
**I actually love to do this task myself when I am home, but since I was away on a business trip, Carlos was happy to do the job.**  
**When bathing pets, it’s important to always use lukewarm water and only mild pet shampoos** --- we use my own Martha Stewart shampoos and conditioners from my collection on Amazon.  

Here are some photos, enjoy.

**Empress Qin is ready for a good summertime bath.**  
**Here she is in the back of my Polaris Ranger.**  
**Everyone at the farm loves our fleet of Polaris vehicles.**  
**They’re extremely efficient, easy-to-drive, and can go where other vehicles cannot.**  

**The Chows are getting washed in the stable.**  
This shower stall is located at one end.  
**It is a large stall with padded lower walls for animal safety.**  
The faucets are housed in a cabinet on the right to keep them out of the way.  
The shower stall is also equipped with heaters suspended from the ceiling if needed.  
**The boom sprayer is very flexible and can swivel around easily.**  


**My line of shampoos and conditioners are all-natural, hypoallergenic and gentle enough for regular bathing.**  
The formulas are also paraben and sulfate-free.  
**My moisturizing shampoo and conditioner cleanse and intensely moisturize the dog’s skin and coat.**  
**When bathing a dog, it’s essential to use products made especially for dogs because of the differences in pH balance.**  

**Han is first --- once he feels the lukewarm water, Han starts to relax.**  
Han is four-years-old and such a good boy.  

**My dogs are very accustomed to being bathed.**  
They’ve had many baths, but always keep an eye on any dog who is getting washed --- just in case they want to make a quick move.  

**Apply the shampoo from the back of the ears to the tail and always be very careful around the face, ears, and eyes.**  

**Carlos makes sure to apply shampoo to the dog’s stomach as well.**  
**My shampoo formulas are all great for pets with sensitive skin.**  

After applying the shampoo and letting it soak into the coat a few minutes, Carlos rinses well with lukewarm water.  
**It is very important to get all the shampoo out --- a rule of thumb is to keep rinsing until there are no visible bubbles on the coat --- and then rinse a little more.**  
**Next, Carlos also applies conditioner and then rinses Han thoroughly again.**  

**Qin is a champion show dog, so she is also very used to getting bathed and groomed.**  
My Qin is so beautiful.  
**Here, Carlos pours a small amount of shampoo to Qin’s coat --- it lathers pretty quickly.**  

**Carlos wears a full rain suit and boots, so he doesn’t get wet.**  
Here he is stopping for a quick photo with Qin.  
Carlos shampoos Qin’s entire coat from head to tail.  

**Carlos scrubs carefully to soap every part of Qin’s body.**  

**Carlos also makes sure to clean the feet, legs and underneath where dirt can accumulate.**  
**He talks to her as he is scrubbing.**  
**Qin is a good girl and stays very still for the entire process.**  

After soaping and rinsing, Carlos applies the conditioner and brushes Qin while it is absorbed into the coat.  

**Then she is rinsed thoroughly once again, making sure there is no shampoo or conditioner left on the coat at all --- the water needs to penetrate all the layers of the dog’s heavy coat.**  

Carlos dries Qin very, very well.  
**Here she is getting wiped down with a large terry towel.**  
**This is a good time to have the dog shake the water off.**  
Train the dog to shake on command, so no one gets wet in the process.  

The coat must be dried thoroughly.  
**Carlos uses a professional pet hair dryer to blow the coat.**  
**Drying completely is crucial.**  
**Otherwise, the hair closest to the skin will pack down, retain dirt and moisture, and cause skin irritations.**  

**The benefit of using a hair dryer specifically for pets is that they’re not really drying the dog by heat so much as blasting the water out of the fur.**  
These powerful dryers also blow loose fur from their undercoat which means less shedding later.  

Carlos dries the feet thoroughly, including in between the dog’s pads.  
**If one chooses to use a hair dryer for humans, always put it to the no-heat setting.**  
Never use high heat on a dog’s coat.  
**Dogs are much more sensitive to external heat than humans are and have a far more difficult time dissipating heat.**  

Here’s Qin after she’s dry and well brushed.  
She looks great.  
There are two types of coat on a Chow Chow --- rough and smooth.  
Both are double-coated.  
Qin is a rough-coated Chow.  
**The outer coat is abundant, dense, and straight.**  
The undercoat is soft and woolly.  
Chows should be sturdy and squarely built.  
**Its body should be compact, and heavy-boned --- Qin has a perfect body.**  

**Here’s Han getting dried and brushed.**  
I think Han enjoys his “spa” treatments.  

According to the breed standard, Chows must have a lovely thick mane, with small rounded ears, giving it the appearance of a lion when all grown up.  
Han is a handsome boy.  

All clean and ready to go!  
Once they’re done, the Chows are driven back up to my Winter House in my Polaris.  
Next for a bath ... my Frenchies.

## Podcast-Huberman-2021_01_05

* From:【[HOW YOUR BRAIN WORKS & CHANGES](https://hubermanlab.com/how-your-nervous-system-works-and-changes/)】

* From:【[How Your Nervous System Works & Changes | Huberman Lab Podcast #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-XfCl-HpRM)】


Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life.  
(upbeat guitar music) I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
at Stanford School of Medicine.  
For today's podcast we're going to talk about the parts list of the nervous system.  
**Now that might sound boring, but these are the bits and pieces that together make up everything
about your experience of life, from what you think about to what you feel, what you imagine,
and what you accomplish from the day you're born until the day you die.**  
**That parts list is really incredible because it has a history associated with it that really provides a window into all sorts of things like engineering, warfare, religion, and philosophy.**  
So I'm going to share with you the parts list that makes up who you are through the lens of some of those other aspects of life and other aspects of the history of the discovery of the nervous system.  
**By the end of this podcast I promise you're going to understand a lot more about how you work and how to apply that knowledge.**  
There's going to be a little bit of story.  
**There's going to be a lot of discussion about the people who made these particular discoveries.**  
There'll be a little bit of technical language.  
**There's no way to avoid that.**  
**But at the end you're going to have in hand what will be the equivalent of an entire semester of learning about the nervous system and how you work.**  
So a few important points before we get started.  
**I am not a medical doctor.**  
**That means I don't prescribe anything.**  
**I'm a professor, so sometimes I'll profess things.**  
**In fact, I profess a lot of things.**  
**We are going to talk about some basic functioning of the nervous system parts and et cetera, but we're also going to talk about how to apply that knowledge.**  
That said, your healthcare, your wellbeing is your responsibility.  
So anytime we talk about tools please filter it through that responsibility.  
Talk to a healthcare professional if you're going to explore any new tools or practices and be smart in your pursuit of these new tools.  
**Also wanna emphasize that this podcast and the other things I do on social media are my personal goal of bringing zero cost to consumer information to the general public.**  
**It is separate from my role at Stanford University.**  
In that spirit I really want to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.  
The first one is Athletic Greens which is an all-in-one drink.  
It's a greens drink that has vitamins, minerals, probiotics, prebiotics.  
I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012 so I'm really delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.  
The reason I like it is because I like vitamins and minerals, I think they're important to my health and it can be kind of overwhelming to know what to take in that landscape.  
So by taking one thing that also happens to taste really good I get all the vitamins minerals, et cetera, that I need.  
**There's also a lot of data there now about the importance of the gut microbiome for immune health and for the gut brain access, all these things.**  
And the probiotics and prebiotics are important to me for that reason.  
If you want to try Athletic Greens you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman, and put in the code word Huberman at checkout.  
**If you do that they'll send you a year's supply of vitamin D3 and K2.**  
**There's a lot in the news lately about the importance of vitamin D3.**  
**We can all get vitamin D3 from sunlight but many of us aren't getting enough sunlight.**  
Vitamin D3 has been shown to be relevant to the immune system and the hormone systems, et cetera.  
So once again that's athleticgreens.com/huberman, enter Huberman at checkout, and you get the year supply of D3 and K2 along with your Athletic Greens.  
This podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker which is a health monitoring company.  
**It uses blood tests and saliva tests to look at things like DNA and metabolic markers and monitors your hormones, a huge number of different parameters of health that really can only be measured accurately through blood and saliva tests.**  
**I use Inside Tracker because I'm a big believer in data.**  
**There's a lot of aspects to our biology that can only be accurately measured by way of blood tests and saliva tests.**  
The thing that's really nice about Inside Tracker is that rather than just giving you a bunch of numbers back of the levels of these things in your body, it gives you, through a really simple platform, information about what to do with all those levels of hormones and metabolic markers, et cetera.  
**It also has a feature which is particularly interesting which it measures your inner age, which is more a measure of your biological age as opposed to your chronological age.**  

**And all that information is organized so that you can make changes in your nutritional regimes or your exercise regimes and watch how those markers change over time.**  
So if you want to try Inside Tracker you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman and they'll give you 25% off at checkout.  

So let's talk about the nervous system.  
**The reason I say your nervous system and not your brain is because your brain is actually just one piece of this larger, more important thing, frankly, that we call the nervous system.**  
**The nervous system includes your brain and your spinal cord but also all the connections between your brain and your spinal cord and the organs of your body.**  
**It also includes, very importantly, all the connections between your organs back to your spinal cord and brain.**  
**So the way to think about how you function at every level from the moment you're born until the day you die, everything you think and remember and feel and imagine is that your nervous system is this continuous loop of communication between the brain, spinal cord, and body and body, spinal cord, and brain.**  



In fact, we really can't even separate them.  
It's one continuous loop.  
You may have heard of something called a Mobius strip.  
**A Mobius strip is almost like one of these impossible figures that no matter which angle you look at it from you can't tell where it starts and where it ends.**  
And that's really how your nervous system is built.  
**That's the structure that allows you to, for instance, deploy immune cells, to release cells that will go kill infection when you're in the presence of infection.**  
**Most people just think about that as a function of the immune system but actually it's your nervous system that tells organs like your spleen to release killer cells that go and hunt down those bacterial and viral invaders and gobble them up.**  
**If you have a stomach ache, for instance, sure, you feel that in your stomach, but it's really your nervous system that's causing the stomach ache.**  
**The ache aspect of it is a nervous system feature.**  
**So when we want to talk about experience or we want to talk about how to change the self in any way, we really need to think about the nervous system first.**  
**It is fair to say that the nervous system governs all other biological systems of the body, and it's also influenced by those other biological systems.**  

So if we're talking about the nervous system we need to get a little specific about what we mean. It's not just this big loop of wires.  
**In fact, there's a interesting story about that because at the turn of the sort of 1800s to 1900s, it actually was believed that our nervous system was just one giant cell.**  
**But two guys, that names aren't super important, but in fairness to their important discovery, Ramon y Cajal, a Spaniard, Camillo Golgi, an Italian guy, figured out how to label or stain the nervous system in a way that revealed, oh my goodness, we're actually made up of trillions of these little cells, nerve cells that are called neurons.**  
And that's what a neuron is.  
It's just a nerve cell.  
**They also saw that those nerve cells weren't touching one another.**  
**They're actually separated by little gaps.**  
**And those little gaps you may have heard of before, they're called synapses.**  
**Those synapses are where the chemicals from one neuron are kind of spit out or vomited into.**  
**And then the next nerve cell detects those chemicals and then passes electricity down its length
to the next nerve cell and so forth.**  
So really the way to think about your body and your thoughts and your mind is that you are a flow of electricity, right?  
There's nothing mystical about this.  
You're a flow of electricity between these different nerve cells.  
And depending on which nerve cells are active you might be lifting your arm or lowering your arm.  
You might be seeing something and perceiving that it's red or you might be seeing something and perceiving that it's green, all depending on which nerve cells are electrically active at a given moment.  
**The example of perceiving red or perceiving green is a particularly good example because so often our experience of the world makes it seem as if these out these things that are happening outside us are actually happening inside us.**  
**But the language of the nervous system is just electricity.**  
It's just like a Morse code of some sort or the syllables and words and consonants and vowels of language.  
**It just depends on how they're assembled, what order.**  



And so that brings us to the issue of how the nervous system works.  
The way to think about how the nervous system works is that our experiences, our memories, everything is sort of like the keys on a piano being played in a particular order, right?  
If I play the keys on a piano in a particular order and with a particular intensity, that's a given song.  
We can make that analogous to a given experience.  
**It's not really that the key, you know, A sharp or E flat is the song.**  
It's just one component of the song.  
**So when you hear that, you know, for instance, there's a brain area called the hippocampus, which there is, that's involved in memory.**  
Well, it's involved in memory, but it's not that memories are stored there as, you know,  sentences.  
**They're stored there as patterns of electricity in neurons that when repeated, give you the sense that you are experiencing the thing again.**  
**In fact, deja vu, the sense that what you're experiencing is so familiar and like something that you've experienced previously is merely that the neurons that were active in one circumstance are now becoming active in the same circumstance again.**  
And so it's really just like hearing the same song maybe not played on a piano but next time on a classical guitar, there's something similar about that song even though it's being played on two different instruments.  
**So I think it's important that people understand the parts of their nervous system, and that it includes so much more than just the brain and that there are these things, neurons and synapses.**  
**But really that it's the electrical activity of these neurons that dictates our experience.**  
So if the early 1900s were when these neurons were discovered, certainly a lot has happened since then.  
**And in that time between the early 1900s and now there's some important events that actually happened in history that gave us insight into how the nervous system works.**  
**One of the more surprising ones was actually warfare.**  
**So as most everybody knows in warfare people get shot and people often die but many people get shot and they don't die.**  
**And in World War One, there were some changes in artillery, in bullets that made for a situation where bullets would enter the body and brain at very discrete locations and would go out the other side of the body or brain and also make a very small hole at that exit location.**  
**And in doing so produced a lot of naturally occurring lesions of the nervous system.**  
**Now you say, okay, well, how does that relate to neuroscience?**  



Well, unlike previous years where a lot of the artillery would create these big sort of holes as the bullets would blow out of the brain or body, I know this is rather gruesome, when the holes were very discrete they entered at one point and left at another point, they would take out or destroy very discrete bits of neural tissue, of the nervous system.  
So people were coming back from war with holes in their brain and in other parts of their nervous system that were limited to very specific locations.  
**In addition to that, there was some advancement in the cleaning of wounds that happened so many more people were surviving.**  
What this meant was that neurologists now had a collection of patients that would come back and they'd have holes in very specific locations of their brain.  
**And they'd say things like, well, I can recognize faces but I can't recognize who those faces belong to.**  
**I know it's a face, but I don't know who it belongs to.**  
**And after that person eventually died the neurologist would figure out, ah, I've had 10 patients that all told me that they couldn't recognize faces.**  
**And they all had these bullet holes that went through a particular region of the brain.**  
**And that's how we know a lot about how particular brain regions like the hippocampus work.**    
**In fact, some of the more amazing examples of this, where people would come back and they, for instance, would speak in complete gibberish whereas previously they could speak normally.**  
**And even though they were speaking in complete gibberish they could understand language perfectly.**  
**That's how we know that speech and language are actually controlled by separate portions of the nervous system.**  
**And there are many examples like that.**  
People that couldn't recognize the faces of famous people or, and that actually brings us to an interesting example in modern times.  
**Many, many years later in the early 2000s there was actually a paper that was published in the journal "Nature", excellent journal, showing that in a human being, a perfectly healthy human being, there was a neuron that would become electrically active only when the person viewed the picture of Jennifer Aniston, the actress.**  
**So literally a neuron that represented Jennifer Aniston, so-called Jennifer Aniston cells, neuroscientists know about the Jennifer Aniston cells.**  
If you can recognize Jennifer Aniston's face you have Jennifer Aniston neurons, and presumably also have neurons that can recognize the faces of other famous and non-famous people.  
So that indicates that our brain is really a map of our experience.  
We come into the world and our brain has a kind of bias towards learning particular kinds of things.  
It's ready to receive information and learn that information, but the brain is really a map of experience.  
So let's talk about what experience really is.  
What does it mean for your brain to work?  
**Well I think it's fair to say that the nervous system really does five things, maybe six.**  
The first one is sensation.  
**So this is important to understand for any and all of you that want to change your nervous system or to apply tools to make your nervous system work better.**  
**Sensation is a non-negotiable element of your nervous system.**  
**You have neurons in your eye that perceive certain colors of light and certain directions of movement.**  
**You have neurons in your skin that perceive particular kinds of touch, like light touch or firm touch or painful touch.**  
**You have neurons in your ears that perceive certain sounds.**  
Your entire experience of life is filtered by these, what we call sensory receptors if you want to know what the name is.  
**So this always raises an interesting question.**  
People ask, well, is there much more out there?  
Is there a lot more happening in the world that I'm not experiencing or that humans aren't experiencing?  
**And the answer of course is yes, there are many species on this planet that are perceiving things that we will never perceive unless we apply technology.**  
The best example I could think of off the top of my head would be something like infrared vision.  
**There are snakes out there, pit vipers and so forth, that can sense heat emissions from other animals.**  



They don't actually see their shape.  
They sense their heat shape and their heat emissions.  
**Humans can't do that unless of course they put on infrared goggles or something that would allow them to detect those heat emissions.**  
**There are turtles and certain species of birds that migrate long distances that can detect magnetic fields because they have neurons, again, it's the nervous system that allows them to do this.**  
**So they have neurons in their nose and in their head that allow them to migrate along magnetic fields in order to, as amazing as this sounds, go from one particular location in the ocean,
thousands of miles away to all aggregate on one particular beach at a particular time of year so that they can mate, lay eggs, and then wander back off into the sea to die.**  
**And then their young will eventually hatch, those cute little turtles will shuffle to the ocean,
swim off and go do the exact same thing.**  
**They don't migrate that distance by vision.**  
**They don't do it by smell.**  
**They do it by sensing magnetic fields.**  
**And many other species do these incredible things.**  
**We don't, humans are not magnetic sensing organisms**.  
**We can't do that because we don't have receptors that sense magnetic fields.**  
There's some data that maybe some humans can sense magnetic fields but you should be very skeptical of anyone that's convinced that they can do that with any degree of robustness or accuracy, because even the people that can do this aren't necessarily aware that they can.  
Maybe a topic for a future podcast.  
**So we have sensation, then we have perception.**  
Perception is our ability to take what we're sensing and focus on it and make sense of it,
to explore it, to remember it.  
So really perceptions are just whichever sensations we happen to be paying attention to at any moment.  
And you can do this right now.  
You can experience perception and the difference between perception and sensation very easily.  
If, for instance, I tell you to pay attention to the contact of your feet, the bottoms of your feet, with whatever surface they happen to be in contact with, maybe it's shoes, maybe it's the floor, if your feet are up maybe it's air.  
**The moment you place your, what we call the spotlight of attention or the spotlight of perception on your feet.**  
**You are now perceiving what was happening there, what was being sensed there.**  
The sensation was happening all along however.  


**So while sensation is not negotiable you can't change your receptors unless you adopt some new technology, perception is under the control of your attention.**  
**And the way to think about attention is it's like a spotlight, except it's not one spotlight.**  
You actually have two attentional spotlights.  
**Anyone that tells you you can't multitask, tell them they're wrong.**  
**And if they disagree with you tell them to contact me because in old world primates of which humans are, we are able to do what's called covert attention.**  
**We can place a spotlight of attention on something, for instance, something we're reading or looking at or someone that we're listening to.**  
**And we can place a second spotlight of attention on something we're eating and how it tastes or our child running around in the room or my dog.**  

You can split your attention into two locations but of course you can also bring your attention,
that is, your perception, to one particular location.  
You can dilate your attention kind of like making a spotlight more diffuse or you can make it more concentrated.  
This is very important to understand if you're going to think about tools to improve your nervous system, whether or not that tool is in the form of a chemical that you decide to take, maybe a supplement to increase some chemical in your brain if that's your choice, or a brain machine device or you're going to try and learn something better by engaging in some focus or motivated pursuit for some period of time each day.  
**Attention is something that is absolutely under your control, in particular when you're rested.**  
And we'll get back to this.  
But when you are rested, and we'll define rest very clearly, you are able to direct your attention in very deliberate ways.  

**And that's because we have something in our nervous system which is sort of like a two way street.**  
**And that two way street is a communication between the aspects of our nervous system that are reflexive and the aspects of our nervous system that are deliberate.**  
So we all know what it's like to be reflexive.  
You go through life, you're walking.  
**If you already know how to walk you don't think about your walking.**  
You just walk.
**And that's because the nervous system wants to pass off as much as it can to reflexive action.**
That's called bottom up processing.  
It really just means that information is flowing in through your senses, regardless of what you're perceiving, that information is flowing up and it's directing your activity.  
**But at any moment, for instance, let's say a car screeches in front of you around the corner,
and you suddenly pause.**  
**You are now moving into deliberate action.**  

You would start looking around in a very deliberate way.  
**The nervous system can be reflexive in its action or it can be deliberate.**  
If reflexive action tends to be what we call bottom up, deliberate action and deliberate perceptions and deliberate thoughts are top down.  
**They require some effort and some focus.**  



But that's the point, you can decide to focus your attention and energy on anything you want.  
You can decide to focus your behavior in any way you want.  
**But it will always feel like it requires some effort and some strain.**  
**Whereas when you're in reflexive mode, just walking and talking and eating and doing your thing
it's going to feel very easy.**  
**And that's because your nervous system basically wired up to be able to do most things easily without much metabolic demand, without consuming much energy.**  
**But the moment you try and do something very specific, you're going to feel a sort of mental friction.**  
It's going to be challenging.  
**So we've got sensations, perceptions, and then we've got things that we call feelings slash emotions.**  
And these get a little complicated because almost all of us, I would hope all of us, are familiar with things like happiness and sadness or boredom or frustration.  
**Scientists argue like crazy, neuroscientists and psychologists and philosophers for that matter, argue like crazy about what these are and how they work.**  
**Certainly emotions and feelings are the product of the nervous system.**  
They involve the activity of neurons.  
**But as I mentioned earlier, neurons are electrically active but they also release chemicals.**  
**And there's a certain category of chemicals that has a very profound influence on our emotional states.**  
They're called neuromodulators.  
And those neuromodulators have names that probably you've heard of before.  
**Things like dopamine and serotonin and acetylcholine, epinephrine.**  
**Neuromodulators are really interesting because they bias which neurons are likely to be active
and which ones are likely to be inactive.**  
**A simple way to think about neuromodulators is they are sort of like playlists that you would have on any kind of device where you're going to play particular categories of music.**  
**So for instance, dopamine, which is often discussed as the molecule of reward or joy, it is involved in reward.**  
**And it does tend to create a sort of upbeat mood when released in appropriate amounts in the brain.**  
**But the reason it does that is because it makes certain neurons and neural circuits as we call them more active and others less active.**  
Okay.  
**So serotonin, for instance, is a molecule that when released tends to make us feel really good with what we have, our sort of internal landscape and the resources that we have, whereas dopamine more than being a molecule of reward is really more a molecule of motivation toward things that are outside us and that we want to pursue.**  
**And we can look at healthy conditions or situations like being in pursuit of a goal where every time we accomplish something en route to that goal, a little bit of dopamine is released
and we feel more motivation, that happens.**  
**We can also look at the extreme example of something like mania, where somebody is so relentlessly in pursuit of external things like money and relationships that they're sort of in this delusional state of thinking that they have the resources that they need in order to pursue all these things when in fact they don't.**  
So these neuromodulators can exist in normal levels, low levels, high levels.  
**And that actually gives us a window into a very important aspect of neuroscience history that all of us are impacted by today, which is the discovery of antidepressants and so-called anti-psychotics.**  
**In the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, it was discovered that there are compounds, chemicals that can increase or decrease serotonin, that can increase or decrease dopamine.**  

**And that led to the development of most of what we call antidepressants.**  
**Now, the trick here or the problem is that most of these drugs, especially in the 1950s and '60s, they would reduce serotonin but they would also reduce dopamine or they would increase serotonin, but they would also increase some other neuromodulator chemical.**  
**And that's because all these chemical systems in the body, but the neuromodulators in particular, have a lot of receptors.**  
Now, these are different than the receptors we were talking about earlier.  
The receptors I'm talking about now are sort of like parking spots where dopamine is released.  
**And if it attaches to a receptor, say on the heart, it might make the heart beat faster because there's a certain kind of receptor on the heart.**  
**Whereas if dopamine is released and goes and attaches to muscle it might have a completely different effect on the muscle.**  



And in fact, it does.  
**So different receptors on different organs of the body are the ways that these neuromodulators can have all these different effects on different aspects of our biology.**  
**This is most salient in the example of some of the antidepressants that have sexual side effects or that blunt appetite or that blunt motivation.**  
**You know, many of these which increase serotonin can be very beneficial for people.**  
It can elevate their mood.  
It can make them feel better.  
**But they also if their, the doses are too high or if that particular drug isn't right for somebody that person experiences challenges with motivation or appetite or libido because serotonin is binding to receptors in the areas of the brain that control those other things as well.**  
So we talked about sensation.  
We talked about perception.  
When we talk about feelings, we have to consider these neuromodulators.  
**And we have to consider also that feelings and emotions are contextual.**  
In some cultures showing a lot of joy or a lot of sadness is entirely appropriate, in other cultures it's considered inappropriate.  
So I don't think it's fair to say that there is a sadness circuit or area of the brain or a happiness circuit or area of the brain.  
However, it is fair to say that certain chemicals and certain brain circuits tend to be active
when we are in motivated states, tend to be active when we are in non-motivated lazy states,
tend to be active when we are focused and tend to be active when we are not focused.  
**I want to emphasize also that emotions are something that we generally feel are not under our control.**  
We feel like they kind of geyser up within us and they just kind of happen to us.  

**And that's because they are somewhat reflexive.**  
**We don't really set out with a deliberate thought to be happy or a deliberate thought to be sad.**  
**We tend to experience them in kind of a passive reflexive way.**  
**And that brings us to the next thing, which are thoughts.**  
**Thoughts are really interesting because in many ways they're like perceptions except that they draw on not just what's happening in the present but also things we remember from the past and things that we anticipate about the future.**  
**The other thing about thoughts that's really interesting is that thoughts can be both reflexive,
they can just be occurring all the time sort of like pop-up windows on a poorly filtered web browser, or they can be deliberate.**  



We can decide to have a thought.  
In fact, right now you could decide to have a thought just like you would decide to write something out on a piece of paper.  
You could decide that you're listening to a podcast, that you are in a particular location.  
You're not just paying attention to what's happening, you're directing your thought process.  
**And a lot of people don't understand or at least appreciate that the thought patterns and the neural circuits that underlie thoughts can actually be controlled in this deliberate way.**  
And then finally there are actions.  
Actions or behaviors are perhaps the most important aspect of our nervous system.  
**Because first of all, our behaviors are actually the only thing that are going to create any fossil record of our existence.**  
**You know, after we die, the nervous system deteriorates, our skeleton will remain.**  
But it's, you know, in the moment of experiencing something very joyful or something very sad, it can feel so all encompassing that we actually think that it has some meaning beyond that moment.  
**But actually for humans and I think for all species, the sensations, the perceptions and the thoughts and the feelings that we have in our lifespan, none of that is actually carried forward except the ones that we take and we convert into actions such as writing, actions such as words, actions such as engineering new things.**  
**And so the fossil record of our species and each one of us is really through action.**  
And that, in part, is why so much of our nervous system is devoted to converting sensation, perceptions, feelings, and thoughts into actions.  
**In fact, the great neuroscientist or physiologist Sherrington won a Nobel prize for his work in mapping some of the circuitry, the connections between nerve cells that give rise to movement.**  



And he said, "Movement is the final common pathway".  
The other way to think about it is that one of the reasons that our central nervous system,
our brain and spinal cord include this stuff in our skull but also connects so heavily to the body is because most everything that we experience, including our thoughts and feelings, was really designed to either impact our behavior or not.  
And the fact that thoughts allow us to reach into the past and anticipate the future and not just experience what's happening in the moment gave rise to an incredible capacity for us to engage in behaviors that are not just for the moment, they're based on things that we know from the past and that we would like to see in the future.  
**And this aspect of our nervous system, of creating movement, occurs through some very simple pathways.**  
The reflexive pathway basically includes areas of the brain stem we call central pattern generators.  
**When you walk, provided you already know how to walk, you are basically walking because you have these central pattern generators, groups of neurons that generate right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot kind of movement.**  
However, when you decide to move in a particular deliberate way that requires a little more attention you start to engage areas of your brain for top-down processing where your forebrain works from the top down to control those central pattern generators so that maybe it's right foot, right foot, left foot, right foot, right foot, left foot if maybe you're hiking along some rocks or something.  
And you have to engage in that kind of movement.  
**So movement, just like thoughts, can be either reflexive or deliberate.**  

And when we talk about deliberate I want to be very specific about how your brain works in a deliberate way because it gives rise to a very important feature of the nervous system that we're going to talk about next, which is your ability to change your nervous system.  
And what I'd like to center on for a second is this notion of what does it mean for the nervous system to do something deliberately?  
**Well, when you do something deliberately, you pay attention, you are bringing your perception to an analysis of three things, duration, how long something is is going to take or should be done, path, what you should be doing, and outcome, if you do something for a given length of time, what's going to happen.**  

**Now when you're walking down the street or you're eating or you're just talking reflexively, you're not doing this what I call DPO, duration, path, outcome, type of deliberate function in your brain and nervous system.**  
**But the moment you decide to learn something or to resist speaking or to speak up when you would rather be quiet, anytime you're deliberately kind of forcing yourself over a threshold, you're engaging these brain circuits and these nervous system circuits that suddenly make it feel as if something is challenging.**  
**Something has changed.**  
Well, what's changed?  
**What's changed is that when you engage in this duration, path, and outcome type of thinking or behavior or way of being you start to recruit these neuromodulators that are released from particular areas of your brain, and also it turns out from your body.**  

and they start cuing to your nervous system.  
Something's different.  
Something's different now about what I'm doing.  
Something's different about what I'm feeling.  
Let's give an example where perhaps somebody says something that's triggering to you.  
You don't like it.  
And you know you shouldn't respond.    
You feel like, oh, I shouldn't respond, I shouldn't respond, I shouldn't respond.  
You're actively suppressing your behavior through top down processing.  
**Your forebrain is actually preventing you from saying the thing that you know you shouldn't say or that maybe you should wait to say or say in a different form.**  

This feels like agitation and stress because you're actually suppressing a circuit.  
We actually can see examples of what happens when you're not doing this well.  
Some of the examples come from children.  
**If you look at young children they don't have the forebrain circuitry to engage in this top down processing until they reach age 22, even 25.**  
But in young children, you see this in a really robust way.  
You'll see they'll be rocking back and forth.  
**It's hard for them to sit still because those central pattern generators are constantly going in the background.**  
**Whereas adults can sit still.**  
**A kid sees a piece of candy that it wants and will just reach out and grab it.**  
**Whereas an adult probably would ask if they could have a piece or wait until they were offered a piece in most cases.**  
**People that have damage to the certain areas of the frontal lobes don't have this kind of restriction.**  
**They'll just blurt things out.**  
They'll just say things.  
We all know people like this.  
**Impulsivity is a lack of top down control, a lack of top-down processing.**  



**The other thing that will turn off the forebrain and make it harder to top-down processing is a couple of drinks containing alcohol.**  
The removal of inhibition is actually removal of neural inhibition, of nerve cells suppressing the activity of other nerve cells.  
**And so when you look at people that have damage to their frontal lobes or you look at puppies or you look at young children, everything's a stimulus.**  
**Everything is a potential interaction for them.**  
**And they have a very hard time restricting their behavior and their speech.**  
So a lot of the motor system is designed to just work in a reflexive way.  
**And then when we decide we want to learn something or do something or not do something, we have to engage in this top-down restriction.**  

**And it feels like agitation because it's accompanied by the release of a neuromodulator called norepinephrine, which in the body we call adrenaline.**  
And it actually makes us feel agitated.  
**So for those of you that are trying to learn something new or to learn to suppress your responses or be more deliberate and careful in your responses, that is going to feel challenging for a particular reason.**  
**It's going to feel challenging because the chemicals in your body that are released in association with that effort are designed to make you feel kind of agitated.**  
**That low-level tremor that sometimes people feel when they're really, really angry is actually a chemically induced low-level tremor.**  

And it's the, what I call limbic friction.  
**There's an area of your brain that's involved in our more primitive reflexive responses called the limbic system.**  
**And the frontal cortex is in a friction, it's in a tug of war with that system all the time.**  

**Unless of course you have damage to the frontal lobe or you've had too much to drink or something.**  
In which case you tend to just say and do whatever.  
**And so this is really important to understand because if you want to understand neuroplasticity, you want to understand how to shape your behavior, how to shape your thinking, how to change how you're able to perform in any context, the most important thing to understand is that it requires top-down processing.**  
**It requires this feeling of agitation.**  
**In fact, I would say the agitation and strain is the entry point to neuroplasticity.**  
**So let's take a look at what neuroplasticity is.**  
Let's explore it, not as the way it's normally talked about in modern culture, neuroplasticity, plasticity is great.  
Well, what exactly do people mean?  
**Plasticity itself is just a process by which neurons can change their connections and the way they work so that you can go from things being very challenging and deliberate, requiring a lot of effort and strain, to them being reflexive.**  

**And typically when we hear about plasticity, we're thinking about positive or what I call adaptive plasticity.**  
A lot of plasticity can be induced, for instance by brain damage, but that's generally not the kind of plasticity that we want.  
So when I say plasticity, unless I say otherwise I mean adaptive plasticity.  
And in particular most of the neuroplasticity that people want is self-directed plasticity.  

**Because if there's one truism to neuroplasticity, it's that from birth until about age 25
the brain is incredibly plastic.**  

**Kids are learning all sorts of things but they can learn it passively.**  
**They don't have to work too hard or focus too hard, although focus helps, to learn new things,
acquire new languages, acquire new skills.**  
**But if you're an adult and you want to change your neural circuitry at the level of emotions or behavior or thoughts or anything really, you absolutely need to ask two important questions.**  
* One, what particular aspect of my nervous system am I trying to change?  
Meaning, am I trying to change my emotions or my perceptions, my sensations?  
And which ones are available for me to change?  

* And then the second question is how are you going to go about that?  
What is the structure of a regimen to engage neuroplasticity?  

**And it turns out that the answer to that second question is governed by how awake or how sleepy we are.**  
So let's talk about that next.  
**Neuroplasticity is the ability for these connections in the brain and body to change in response to experience.**  
**And what's so incredible about the human nervous system in particular is that we can direct our own neural changes.**  
**We can decide that we want to change our brain.**  
**In other words, our brain can change itself and our nervous system can change itself.**  



And the same can't be said for other organs of the body.  
Even though our other organs of the body have some ability to change, they can't direct it.  
They can't think and decide, you know your gut doesn't say, oh, you know, I want to be able to digest spicy foods better so I'm going to rearrange the connections to be able to do that.  
**Whereas your brain can decide that you want to learn a language or you want to be less emotionally reactive or more emotionally engaged, and you can undergo a series of steps that will allow your brain to make those changes so that eventually it becomes reflexive for you to do that, which is absolutely incredible.**  
**For a long time it was thought that neuroplasticity was the unique gift of young animals and humans, that it could only occur when we're young.**  
**And in fact, a young brain is incredibly plastic.**  
**Children can learn three languages without an accent reflexively, whereas adults, it's very challenging. ** 
**It takes a lot more effort and strain, a lot more of that duration, path, outcome kind of thinking in order to achieve those plastic changes.**  
**We now know, however, that the adult brain can change in response to experience.**  

Nobel prizes were given for the understanding that the young brain can change very dramatically.  
**I think one of the most extreme examples would be for people that are born blind from birth
they use the area of their brain that normally would be used for visualizing objects and colors
and things outside of them for braille reading.**  
**In brain imaging studies it's been shown that, you know, people who are blind from birth, when they braille read, the area of the brain that would normally light up, if you will, for vision
lights up for braille reading.**  
So that real estate is reallocated for an entirely different function.  
If someone is made blind in adulthood, it's unlikely that their entire visual brain will be taken over by the areas of the brain that are responsible for touch.  
**However, there's some evidence that areas of the brain that are involved in hearing and touch can kind of migrate into that area.**  

And there's a lot of interest now in trying to figure out how more plasticity can be induced in adulthood, more positive plasticity.  
**And in order to understand that process we really have to understand something that might at first seem totally divorced from neuroplasticity, but actually lies at the center of neuroplasticity.**  
And for any of you that are interested in changing your nervous system so that something that you want can go from being very hard or seem almost impossible and out of reach to being very reflexive, this is especially important to pay attention to.  
**Plasticity in the adult human nervous system is gated, meaning it is controlled by neuromodulators.**  



**These things that we talked about earlier, dopamine, serotonin, and one in particular called acetylcholine, are what open up plasticity.**  
**They literally unveil plasticity and allow brief periods of time in which whatever information, whatever thing we're sensing or perceiving or thinking, whatever emotions we feel can literally be mapped in the brain such that later it will become much easier for us to experience and feel that thing.**  
**Now, this has a dark side and a positive side.**  
**The dark side is it's actually very easy to get neuroplasticity as an adult through traumatic or terrible or challenging experiences.**  
But the important question is to say, why is that?  
**And the reason that's the case is because when something very bad happens, there's the release of two sets of neuromodulators in the brain, epinephrine which tends to make us feel alert and agitated, which is associated with most bad circumstances.**  
**And acetylcholine, which tends to create a even more intense and focused perceptual spotlight.**  
Remember earlier we were talking about perception and how it's kind of like a spotlight.  
**Acetylcholine makes that light particularly bright and particularly restricted to one region of our experience.**  
**And it does that by making certain neurons in our brain and body active much more than all the rest.**  
So acetylcholine is sorta like a highlighter marker upon which neuroplasticity then comes in later and says, wait, which neurons were active in this particularly alerting phase of whatever, you know, day or night, whenever this thing happened.  
So the way it works is this, you can think of epinephrine as creating this alertness and this kind of unbelievable level of increased attention compared to what you were experiencing before.  
And you can think of acetylcholine as being the molecule that highlights whatever happens during that period of heightened alertness.  
**So just to be clear, it's epinephrine creates the alertness,** that's coming from a subset of neurons in the brain stem if you're interested, and acetylcholine coming from an area of the forebrain is tagging or marking the neurons that are particularly active during this heightened level of alertness.  
Now that marks the cells, the neurons and the synapses for strengthening, for becoming more likely to be active in the future even without us thinking about it.  
Okay?  
So in bad circumstances this all happens without us having to do much.  
When we want something to happen, however, we want to learn a language, we want to learn a new skill, we want to become more motivated, what do we know for certain?  
**We know that that process of getting neuroplasticity so that we have more focus, more motivation, absolutely requires the release of epinephrine.**  



We have to have alertness in order to have focus and we have to have focus in order to direct those plastic changes to particular parts of our nervous system.  
Now, this has immense implications in thinking about the various tools, whether or not those are chemical tools or machine tools or just self-induced regimens of how long or how intensely you're going to focus in order to get neuroplasticity.  
**But there's another side to it.**  
The dirty secret of neuroplasticity is that no neuroplasticity occurs during the thing you're trying to learn, during the terrible event, during the great event.  
**During the thing that you're really trying to shape and learn, nothing is actually changing between the neurons that is going to last.**  
All the neuroplasticity, the strengthening of the synapses, the addition, in some cases, of new nerve cells or at least connections between nerve cells, all of that occurs at a very different phase of life which is when we are in sleep and non-sleep deep rest.  
And so neuroplasticity, which is the kind of Holy Grail of human experience of, you know, this is the New Year and everyone's thinking New Year's resolutions.  
And right now, perhaps everything's organized and people are highly motivated but what happens in March or April or May?  
**Well, that all depends on how much attention and focus one can continually bring to whatever it is they're trying to learn, so much so that agitation and a feeling of strain are actually required for this process of neuro-plasticity to get triggered.**  
**But the actual rewiring occurs during periods of sleep and non-sleep deep rest.**  
**There's a study published last year that's particularly relevant here that I want to share, it was not done by my laboratory, that showed that 20 minutes of deep rest, this is not deep sleep,
but essentially doing something very hard and very intense and then taking 20 minutes immediately afterwards to deliberately turn off the deliberate focused thinking and engagement actually accelerated neuroplasticity.**  
**There's another study that's just incredible.**  
And we're going to go into this in a future episode of the podcast not too long from now, that showed that if people are learning a particular skill, it could be a language skill or a motor skill, and they hear a tone just playing in the background, and the tone is playing periodically in the background, like just a bell.  
**In deep sleep, if that bell is played learning is much faster for the thing that they were learning while they were awake.**  
**It somehow cues the nervous system in sleep, doesn't even have to be in dreaming, that something that happened in the waking phase was especially important.**  
**So much so that that bell is sort of a Pavlovian cue, it's sort of a reminder to the sleeping brain, oh, you need to remember what it is that you were learning at that particular time of day.**  
**And the learning rates and the rates of retention, meaning how much people can remember from the thing they learned, are significantly higher under those conditions.**  
**So I'm going to talk about how to apply all this knowledge a little bit more in this podcast episode but also in future episodes.**  



**But it really speaks to the really key importance of sleep and focus, these two opposite ends of our attentional state.**  
When we're in sleep these DPOs, duration, path, and outcome analysis are impossible.  
We just can't do that.  
We are only in relation to what's happening inside of us.  
So sleep is key.  
**Also key are periods of non-sleep deep rest where we're turning off our analysis of duration, path, and outcome, in particular for the thing that we were just trying to learn.**  

**And we're in this kind of liminal state where our attention is kind of drifting all over.**  
**It turns out that's very important for the consolidation, for the changes between the nerve cells that will allow what we were trying to learn to go from being deliberate and hard and stressful and a strain to easy and reflexive.**  
**This also points to how different people, including many modern clinicians, are thinking about how to prevent bad circumstances, traumas, from routing their way into our nervous system permanently.**  
**It says that you might want to interfere with certain aspects of brain states that are away from the bad thing that happened, the brain states that happened the next day or the next month or the next year.**  

**And also, I want to make sure that I pay attention to the fact that for many of you you're thinking about neuro-plasticity not just in changing your nervous system to add something new but to also get rid of things that you don't like, right?**  
That you want to forget bad experiences or at least remove the emotional contingency of a bad relationship or a bad relationship to some thing or some person or some event.  
**Learning to fear certain things, less to eliminate a phobia, to erase a trauma.**  
**The memories themselves don't get erased.**  

**I'm sorry to say that the memories don't themselves get erased, but the emotional load of memories can be reduced.**  
And there are a number of different ways that that can happen but they all require this thing that we're calling neuroplasticity.  
**We're going to have a large number of discussions about neuroplasticity in depth, but the most important thing to understand is that it is indeed a two phase process.**  



What governs the transition between alert and focused and these deep rest and deep sleep states is a system in our brain and body, a certain aspect of the nervous system called the autonomic nervous system.  
**And it is immensely important to understand how this autonomic nervous system works.**  
It has names like the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system which frankly are complicated names because they're a little bit misleading.  
**Sympathetic is the one that's associated with more alertness.**  
**Parasympathetic is the one that's associated with more calmness.**  

**And it gets really misleading because the sympathetic nervous system sounds like sympathy.**  
And then people think it's related to calm.  
**I'm going to call it the alertness system and the calmness system, because even though sympathetic and parasympathetic are sometimes used, people really get confused.**  
**So the way to think about the autonomic nervous system and the reason it's important for every aspect of your life, but in particular for neuroplasticity and engaging in these focus states and in these de-focused states is that it works sort of like a seesaw.**  

**Every 24 hours, we're all familiar with the fact that when we wake up in the morning we might be a little bit groggy but then generally we're more alert.**  
**And then as evening comes around we tend to become a little more relaxed and sleepy.**  
**Eventually at some point at night, we go to sleep.**  



So we go from alert to deeply calm.  
And as we do that, we go from an ability to engage in these very focused duration, path, outcome
types of analyses to states in sleep that are completely divorced from duration, path, and outcome
in which everything is completely random and untethered in terms of our sensations, perceptions and feelings and so forth.  
**So every 24 hours, we have a phase of our day that is optimal for thinking and focusing and learning and neuroplasticity and doing all sorts of things.**  

We have energy as well.  
**And at another phase of our day we're tired and we have no ability to focus.**  
We have no ability to engage in duration, path, outcome types of analyses.  
**And it's interesting that both phases are important for shaping our nervous system in the ways that we want.**  
**So if we want to engage neuroplasticity and we want to get the most out of our nervous system we each have to master both the transition between wakefulness and sleep and the transition between sleep and wakefulness.**  

Now so much has been made of the importance of sleep.  
**And it is critically important for wound healing, for learning as I just mentioned, for consolidating learning, for all aspects of our immune system.**  
It is the one period of time in which we're not doing these duration, path, and outcome types of analyses.  
**And it is critically important to all aspects of our health, including our longevity.**  
**Much less has been made, however, of how to get better at sleeping, how to get better at the process that involves falling asleep, staying asleep, and accessing the states of mind and body that involve total paralysis.**  

**Most people don't know this but you're actually paralyzed during much of your sleep so that you can't act out your dreams, presumably.**  
But also where your brain is in a total idle state where it's not controlling anything, it's just left to kind of free run.  
**And there are certain things that we can all do in order to master that transition, in order to get better at sleeping.**  
**And it involves much more than just how much we sleep.**  
**We're all being told, of course, that we need to sleep more but there's also the issue of sleep quality, accessing those deep States of non DPO thinking.**  

**Accessing the right timing of sleep, not a lot has been discussed publicly, as far as I'm aware, of when to time your sleep.**  
**I think we all can appreciate that sleeping for half an hour throughout the day so that you get a total of eight hours of sleep every 24 hour cycle is probably very different and not optimal compared to a solid block of eight hours of sleep.**  
Although there are people that have tried this, I think it's been written about in various books. **Not many people can stick to that schedule.**  

Incidentally, I think it's called the Uberman schedule, not to be confused with the Huberman schedule because first of all my schedule doesn't look anything like that.  
**And second of all I would never attempt such a sleeping regime.**  



The other thing that is really important to understand is that we have not explored, as a culture,
the rhythms that occur in our waking states.  
So much has been focused on the value of sleep and the importance of sleep, which is great.  

But I don't think that most people are paying attention to what's happening in their waking states and **when their brain is optimized for focus**, when their brain is optimized for these DPOs, these duration, path, outcome types of engagements for learning and for changing and **when are their brain is probably better suited for more reflexive thinking and behaviors.**  
**And it turns out that there's a vast amount of scientific data which points to the existence of what are called ultradian rhythms.**  
**You may have heard of circadian rhythms.**  
Circadian means, circa, about a day.  
**So it's 24 hour rhythms because the earth spins once every 24 hours.**  
**Ultradian rhythms occur throughout the day and they require less time, they're shorter.**
The most important ultradian rhythm for sake of this discussion is the 90 minute rhythm that we're going through all the time in our ability to attend and focus.  
**And in sleep, we are, our sleep is broken up into 90 minute segments.**  
Early in the night we have more phase one and phase two lighter sleep.  
And then we go into our deeper phase three and phase four sleep.  
And then we return to phase one, two, three, four.  
So all night, you're going through these ultradian rhythms of stage one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, it's repeating.  
Most people perhaps know that.  
Maybe they don't.  
**But you wake up in the morning, these ultradian rhythms continue.**  



And it turns out that we are optimized for focus and attention within these 90 minute cycles so that at the beginning of one of these 90 minute cycles maybe you sit down to learn something new or to engage in some new challenging behavior, for the first five or 10 minutes of one of those cycles it's well-known that the brain and the neural circuits and the neuromodulators are not going to be optimally tuned to whatever it is you're trying to do.  
**But as you drop deeper into that 90 minute cycle your ability to focus and to engage in this DPO process and to direct neuroplasticity and to learn is actually much greater.**  
**And then you eventually pop out of that at the end of the 90 minute cycle.**  



------------------------------------------------------------------



So these cycles are occurring in sleep and these cycles are occurring in wakefulness.  
**And all of those are governed by this seesaw of alertness to calmness that we call the autonomic nervous system.**  
So if you want to master and control your nervous system, regardless of what tool you reach to,
whether or not it's a pharmacologic tool or whether or not it's a behavioral tool or whether or not it's a brain machine interface tool, it's vitally important to understand that your entire existence is occurring in these 90 minute cycles, whether or not you're asleep or awake.  
**And so you really need to learn how to wedge into those 90 minute cycles.**  
**And for instance, it would be completely crazy and counterproductive to try and just learn information while in deep sleep by listening to that information because you're not able to access it.**  
It would be perfectly good, however, to engage in a focused bout of learning each day.  
**And now we know how long that focused bout of learning should be, it should be at least one 90 minute cycle.**  

And the expectation should be that the early phase of that cycle is going to be challenging.  
It's going to hurt.  
It's not going to feel natural.  
It's not going to feel like flow.  
But that you can learn and the circuits of your brain that are involved in focus and motivation can learn to drop into a mode of more focus, get more neuroplasticity in other words, by engaging these ultradian cycles at the appropriate times of day.  
For instance, some people are very good learners early in the day and not so good in the afternoon.  
So you can start to explore this process even without any information about the underlying neurochemicals by simply paying attention, not just to when you go to sleep and when you wake up each morning, how deep or how shallow your sleep felt to you subjectively.  
But also, throughout the day, when your brain tends to be most anxious.  
Because it turns out that has a correlate related to perception that we will talk about.  
You can ask yourself when are you most focused?  
When are you least anxious?  
When do you feel most motivated?  
When do you feel least motivated?  
By understanding how the different aspects of your perception, sensation, feeling, thought, and actions, tend to want to be engaged or not want to be engaged.  
You develop a very good window into what's going to be required to shift your ability to focus or shift your ability to engage in creative type thinking at different times of day, should you choose.  
And so that's where we're heading, going forward.  
It all starts with mastering this seesaw that is the autonomic nervous system, that at a course level is a transition between wakefulness and sleep, but at a finer level, and just as important, are the various cycles, these ultradian 90 minute cycles that govern our life all the time,
24 hours a day every day of our life.  
And so we're going to talk about how you can take control of the autonomic nervous system so that you can better access neuroplasticity, better access sleep, even take advantage of the phase
that is the transition between sleep and waking to access things like creativity and so forth.  
All based on studies that have been published over the last 100 years, mainly within the last 10 years and some that are very, very new.  
And that point to the use of specific tools that will allow you to get the most out of your nervous system.  
So today we covered a lot of information.  
It was sort of a whirlwind tour of everything from neurons and synapses to neuroplasticity and the autonomic nervous system. We will revisit a lot of these themes going forward.  
So if all of that didn't sink in in one pass, please don't worry.  
We will come back to these themes over and over again.  
I wanted to equip you with a language so that we're all developing a kind of common base set of information going forward.  
And I hope the information is valuable to you in your thinking about what is working well for you
and what's working less well and what's been exceedingly challenging, what's been easy for you in terms of your pursuit of particular behaviors or emotional states where your challenges or the challenges of people that you know might reside.  
As promised in our welcome video, the format of the "Huberman Lab" podcast is to dive deep into individual topics for an entire month at a time.  
So for the entire month of January we're going to explore this incredible state that is sleep
and a related state, which is non-sleep deep rest and what they do for things like learning, resetting our emotional capacity.  
Everyone's probably familiar with the fact that when we're sleep deprived we're so much less good at dealing with life circumstances.  
We're more emotionally labile. Why is that?  
How is that? But most importantly, we're going to talk about how to get better at sleeping and how to access better sleep even when your sleep timing or duration is compromised.  
We're also going to talk about the data that support this very interesting state called non-sleep deep rest where one is neither asleep nor awake, but it turns out one can recover some of the neuromodulators and more importantly the processes involved in sensation, perception, feeling, thought, and action.  
It's sure to be a very rich discussion back and forth where I'm answering your questions and providing tools.  
And I'm certain you're also going to learn a lot of information about neuroscience and what makes up this incredible phase of your life where you think you're not conscious, but you're actually resetting and renewing yourself in order to perform better, feel better, et cetera, in the waking state.

* From:【[Cutting Down an American Beech Tree](https://www.themarthablog.com/2022/07/cutting-down-an-american-beech-tree.html)】

> **Note**  
> The following is copied and pasted.  

Maintaining a healthy landscape sometimes means cutting down trees.

**I always feel badly when trees are cut down.**  
**Trees are extremely important to our environment --- they are the world’s single largest source of breathable oxygen, they absorb carbon dioxide and potentially harmful gasses, and they create an ecosystem to provide needed habitat and food for birds and other animals.**  
**However, trees do not live forever, and occasionally they need to be removed.**  
**Last week, one of my American Beech trees lost some branches in a storm**, but this tree was also sick and dying of disease, so it had to come down.  

Here are some photos - enjoy.

**The American beech tree is considered both a shade tree and an ornamental tree.**  
**They can grow to a height of 50 to 70 feet and a spread of around 40 feet at maturity.**  
This American beech tree, located in my American beech tree grove near my Boxwood Allee, has not been looking good for some time.  
It is has been suffering from the beech leaf disease that is spreading rapidly through the Northeast killing both mature American beeches and saplings.  
**Look how bare it is --- healthy beech trees would be filled with leaves this time of year.**  

**A few of the branches were also damaged in a recent storm, so I instructed my outdoor grounds crew to take the entire tree down.**  

**Pasang is our resident arborist.**  
**He is very strong and very skilled at taking down many of the smaller trees around the farm.**  
**Here, he begins with some of the smaller branches closer to the ground.**  

**As all the branches are cut, they are neatly placed in piles, so they are easy to remove later.**  

**Pasang then starts on some of the higher branches --- always securing himself to the tree with the proper safety equipment.**  

Each long section of tree is cut by chainsaw.  
**This tree grows at a slow to medium rate, with height increases of anywhere from less than a foot to about 24-inches per year.**  

**And one by one, the branches fall to the ground.**  

Pasang stops for a quick photo.  
**It’s a warm day at the farm, but we’ve made it through last week’s heat wave.**  
**Temperatures this week are only expected in the 80s.**  

**Here, one can see what the leaf disease does to the leaves.**  
**It causes parts of leaves to turn leathery and withered and then kills a tree within six to 10 years.**  

**In the light, the leaves also show bands --- a clear sign of the beech leaf disease.**  
**An invasive nematode is believed to be responsible for this disease.**  
The microscopic worms are present in the leaves and buds of infected beech trees.  

**The bark of the American beech is gray and mostly smooth.**  
**American beech is often found on moist slopes, in ravines, and atop moist hammocks.**  

**Here is a pile of thicker branches waiting to be discarded.**  
**Because the tree is diseased, we cannot save any of the cut lumber --- the entire tree will be thrown away.**  

**Here’s a pile of smaller branches also neatly piled nearby.**  

Pasang works one section at a time, working his way from the highest point cutting branches and carefully moving down to the ground.  

**Here he is close to the base of the tree.**  
**Almost all the upper branches are now cut off. ** 

**Here is a look at the wood of the tree.**  
**Beech is a hard, strong, and close-grained wood.**  


**Pasang cuts some of the fallen branches into smaller, manageable pieces.**  
**He is using his favorite tool --- a STIHL in-tree gas-powered chainsaw.**  
**It is lightweight and easy to use when up in the trees.**  

And here is the beech tree once it has been emptied of all its top branches --- now only the trunk remains.  

Here is the site after the trunk is cut down.  
**It is always sad to see trees go, but this tree was in poor condition and would have likely succumbed to the disease.**  
It had to come down.  

**This remaining stump and the roots will also be removed, so a new tree can be planted in its place.**  

My outdoor grounds crew foreman, Chhiring, hauls some of the tree branches away to be discarded.  

Thanks Pasang for taking down the tree.  
Pasang takes each section to its designated pile.  
Another big outdoor project done and checked off our list.

* From:【[My Fell Pony Gets New Shoes](https://www.themarthablog.com/2022/07/my-fell-pony-gets-new-shoes.html)】

> **Note**  
> The following is copied and pasted.  

My handsome Fell Pony, Banchunch, is enjoying his new shoes.

**All my horses get new shoes every four to six weeks.**  
**Made of metal or sometimes rubber or other materials, horseshoes are designed to protect the horse’s hooves from wear.**  
Every shoe must be fitted properly in order to prevent mobility issues from developing.  
The horseshoes usually remain on the animal's hooves until the farrier returns to change them, but occasionally a horse will throw a shoe during a ride or just out in the paddock.  
That's exactly what happened to Banchunch --- he threw one of his front shoes, so we called in the farrier, Marc Hill, to come for a visit.

Enjoy these photos.  

**A farrier always has his or her box of important tools.**  
**When we see this in the stable, we know our farrier is not far away.**  
Among the implements needed to change horseshoes are the pullers, a clinch cutter, a brush, and a rasp.

Banchunch threw a shoe the night before while out in the pasture.  
**When this happens it’s important to call in the farrier to replace it quickly.**  
Here’s Banchunch waiting for the farrier, Marc Hill, to start the process.  

**Banchunch has sensitive hooves, so he wears glue-on shoes.**  
**Here, Marc uses old tube socks to protect the feathering on his legs from getting any glue on them.**  
The hoof on left is missing a shoe.  

Next, Marc uses a rasp, or a horse-sized file, to flatten and level the hoof and remove any uneven spots.  
**Hooves grow continuously, so filing the surface when re-shoeing is important for maintaining the horse’s foot balance and gait.**  

This is a hoof buffer attachment for a drill.  
**It quickly removes any marks, rings, or gouges on the hoof wall and helps to prep the hoof for the glue-on shoe.**  

**Rubber glue-on horseshoes absorb shock and vibration.**  
They are applied with a two-part epoxy adhesive that is made specifically for the equine foot.  

**A well-fitted horseshoe should align well with the edge of the hoof.**  
Marc pulls one out to try on Banchunch.  

Marc places the new shoe under Banchunch’s foot and assesses where adjustments are needed.  

**These shoes are pretty flexible and easy to shape for a proper fit.**  

**The hoof must be perfectly smooth for the adhesive to work, so Marc goes over the hoof again with a sanding block to create a clean gluing surface.**  

**My donkeys are so curious.**  
**Clive and Truman “TJ” Junior turn their heads to see what all the commotion is about.**  
**Most donkeys do not wear shoes, but they do need their hooves trimmed and filed regularly.**  

**Once the shoe is put on, Marc picks the hoof up and wraps it with plastic stretch wrap so the new shoe is tight against the hoof wall.**

The wrap holds the shoe in place while the glue is curing.  
**It doesn’t take long for the adhesive to start setting --- the wrap is removed after about 10 to 15 minutes.**  

Meanwhile, Banchunch’s other front hoof is lifted onto a hoof jack, so Marc can remove the other shoe.  

**Then he cleans the bottom of the hoof and removes any debris.**  
Downward strokes from heel to toe are always recommended.  
**Marc is careful around the frog, the triangular portion in the middle of the hoof, which is very sensitive.**  

Here, Banchunch’s left foot is wrapped and the right is unwrapped and ready for any touch-ups.

Marc traces the edges of the shoe with more glue to help seal the shoe rims in place.

Marc adds a bit more glue on the other hoof.  
**The glue is made using some of the same additives as dental adhesives for humans.**  

And that’s it --- Banchunch is all done.  
**New shoes that will last another six weeks.**  

**The shoes still need a little more time to set, so Banchunch is secured for a good grooming.**  

**Once done, my darling Fell pony is now ready for a good rest.**  
See you soon, my handsome Banchunch.

* From:【[Summer Pruning at the Dwarf Apple Espalier](https://www.themarthablog.com/2022/07/summer-pruning-at-the-dwarf-apple-espalier.html)】  

**Here in Bedford, New York, it's going to be another hot, humid, dry weekend with temperatures in the 90s.**  
Despite the uncomfortable summer weather, everyone is doing what they can to maintain the many gardens, groves, allées, and espaliers.  

This time of year, everyone is weeding, watering, and pruning.  
When it comes to pruning, there are different strategies for different times of the year, but overall the goals are the same --- to control the shape, to keep bushes and trees fresh and open, and to allow for better air circulation through the center of the specimen.  
My outdoor grounds crew has already pruned the sculpted hornbeam hedges near my main greenhouse and Winter House as well as the large European beech hedge surrounding my pool.  
Next, the team tackled the apple espaliers and lilac standards behind my long carport.  

Enjoy these photos.  
**And be sure to check out my TikTok @MarthaStewart to see me pruning the Asian pear espalier by my stable!**  

**When I first moved to Bedford, I found a perfect location to plant a little orchard of espalier apple trees --- this space behind my long carport not far from my Winter House.**  
**Espalier refers to an ancient technique, resulting in trees that grow flat, either against a wall, or along a wire-strung framework.**  

These espalier apples have done wonderfully here.  
**They’re supported on wire attached to strong antique granite posts from China originally used as grape supports.**  
There are four rows of espaliered apples.  

**Here are some of the many apples already growing.**  
The apple tree is a deciduous tree in the rose family best known for its sweet, pomaceous fruit, the apple.  
**I have many different varieties growing at my farm.**  
**During a good apple season, my granddaughter Jude and I make lots and lots of cider.**  

**The leaves of apple trees are ovate and dark green with asymmetrical leaf bases.**  
**The leaf margins are curved and serrated.**  

**Here’s Phurba working from the top --- one can see all the new growth that needs trimming.**  

**When he prunes, Phurba cuts branches at a 45 to 60 degree angle.**  
**He is also using pruners for this job.**  
**I always prefer hand tools that will give my trees a more natural appearance and shape.**  
**Every gardener and member of my outdoor grounds crew has a pair.**  

**Chhiring works from the ground --- it’s very hot out, so an umbrella provides some good shade.**  
**Pruning encourages the tree to grow fruiting spurs by eliminating competing suckers and unproductive wood.**  

**As with any pruning project, it’s important to cut the three “Ds” --- dead, diseased, and damaged branches.**  
He also cuts any suckers which helps to keep the tree healthy and directs energy to the branches with fruiting buds.  

The final cut on each unwanted bough needs to be alongside the “branch collar”, where the branch intersects with another.  
**Growth cells concentrate in these nodes, causing fast bark regrowth which seals the cuts.**  

**The job takes a couple days to complete, but it is done carefully and thoughtfully.**  
Look at all the cut branches from just one row of dwarf apple trees.  

**Here are more apples growing --- I am hoping for a bountiful fruit season this fall.**  

Chhiring uses my Stainless Steel Multi-Purpose Folding Pruning Saw available at Martha.com.  
**The 8-inch blade, crafted from Japanese stainless steel, features a strong cross-cutting design for sawing in both directions.**  
**I always make sure my crew gets to use and test the products I design.**  

Here, Chhiring cuts branches that are rubbing or crisscrossing each other, preventing any healthy new growth.  
**Basically, the goal is to create a tree with well spaced lateral branches.**  
**Any branches which interfere with the tree’s shape or create a dense framework should be removed.**  

**Chhiring also focuses on removing crowded branches to help let in light and promote good air circulation.**  

**From the carriage road, one can see the pruned trees in the front and the area still to be pruned in the back.**  
**My long carport is behind the espaliered apple trees.**  
**I hang a series of bird feeders along this side of the carport for all the visiting birds --- about 125 different species of birds visit my feeders.**  

**There is a lot of pruning to do on these trees --- they are healthy and have produced a lot of growth in the last six months.**  
Phurba works from the ground to get under a bit of shade.  
**This day’s temperatures hit 94-degrees Fahrenheit.**  

**By this day’s end, every row is cut just right --- here’s a view from the top.**  
**I am so proud of how productive these trees are --- in part because of the excellent maintenance care we give them.**  

**And here’s a view from the side.**  
**It looks much better now after pruning.**  

These are the leaves of my ‘Miss Kim’ lilac standards.  
**Lilac leaves feature smooth, hairless, heart-shaped leaves.**  

In front of the apple espalier, I have several ‘Miss Kim’ lilac standards lining the edge of the carriage road.  
Phurba did a great job pruning these also.  
‘Miss Kim’ is one of the first dwarf cultivars.  
**It was originated from seeds imported from South Korea.**  
In spring, these trees feature long panicles of sweetly scented lavender blooms that burst from purple buds.  
**I am so glad the gardens are looking beautiful this year --- everyone is working hard.**  
**Now, if we could just get some more rain!**

> **Note**  
> The following is copied and pasted.  

**What projects are on your "to-do" list this weekend?**  
**Here at my Bedford, New York farm, we always have a long list of projects to complete** --- among them, putting shelves up on a bare wall of my guest house studio prep kitchen.  

Mounted shelves free up needed space in any room.  
**Since shelves are intended to bear weight, it's crucial they be installed correctly.**  
One must take the time to locate the wall’s studs and to fasten the shelves securely to supportive brackets.  

**Here are some photos and helpful tips for getting the job done.**  

**As part of the set-up in my guest house studio prep kitchen, it was important to ensure there was enough storage space to accommodate all the necessary equipment --- all the many tools, supplies and table top appliances.**  
**My property manager, Doug White, is a very skilled carpenter.**  
I asked him to make shelves to fit a space and the above bare wall in one corner of the kitchen.  
**Here are the shelves ready to be installed.**  

**These brackets are from one of my previous home collections.**  
**I knew they would be perfect for the above counter shelf.**  

**I instruct everyone on my crew to always have all the right tools for the right jobs.**  
**Doug gathers all the supplies he needs before starting the project.**  

**The first step is to find the wall studs.**  
**Nowadays, one can use a stud finder to locate the wall studs.**  
**These handy tools are available from hardware stores and home improvement centers.**  
Dough holds the stud finder flat against the wall and slowly slides the tool until it beeps and flashes --- this means it’s detected a stud underneath.  
**Most wall studs are spaced 16 to 24 inches apart.**  

**Using a pencil and tape measure, Doug makes a light mark where the shelf bracket screw should go.**  

**Doug holds up one of the shelf’s mounting brackets to make sure it is at the desired height.**  

**Doug then drills the two inch screw into the marked spot and then into the wall stud.**  

**Because the bracket has a keyhole on the back for for the screw, Doug avoids over-tightening it.**  
**Instead, the screw should just be about an eighth of an inch from the wall.**  

**Doug secures the bracket onto the wall --- it is a perfect fit.**  
**If it wiggles slightly, tighten the screw just a bit and secure the bracket again until it is completely secure. He does the same for the other side.**  

Finally, the shelf is put in place on top of the brackets and then checked for level.  
**It is very straight and level.**  

**These shelf brackets are so handsome --- they look wonderful in this location.**

To secure it even more, Doug places two screws through the shelf from the top and into the brackets.  

Here’s Doug next to the new shelf.  

Just underneath the counter, Doug prepares battens for two more shelves.  
Here he is drilling pilot holes where they will be fastened to the wall.  

**A pilot hole is a small hole drilled as a guide for the insertion of a nail or screw.**  

**For one side, which is a metal cabinet, Doug uses self-drilling screws which can go through the metal without needed a separate drilling step.**  

**Here is the self-drilling screw next to a wood screw.**  
One can see how the base of the screw has the drill bit shaped point.  

Doug fastens the self-drilling screw through the batten to secure it to the metal cabinetry behind it.  

**He fastens two other battens on the other side with regular screws into the wall studs.**  

**Lastly, Doug checks for level and plumb.**  

**And the shelves are placed into the space --- they’re also a perfect fit.**  


**Here’s the above counter shelf which also looks great.**  
**It holds and stores our often used appliances nearby without using up needed work space below.**  
**This job took less than an hour to complete and will serve years of good use.**  
**What home projects are you tackling this weekend?**  
Please share them with me in the comments section.  
**I love hearing from all of you.**

The flower garden beds here at my Bedford, New York farm abound with gorgeous, bright and fragrant lilies.  

Lilium is a genus of herbaceous flowering plants that grow from bulbs, all with large prominent flowers.  
The beautiful blooms can be enjoyed as cut flowers in an arrangement or growing in the garden --- some at two feet, and others as tall as eight feet.  
I love lilies, and have been growing them for years --- Asiatic, Martagon, Candidum, American, Longiflorum, Trumpet and Aurelian, Oriental, and various interdivisional hybrids.  

Here are some photos, enjoy.  

**Many of my lilies are planted in my large flower cutting garden just behind my main greenhouse.**  
I also have lilies growing along the winding pergola, outside my Winter House kitchen, in the sunken garden behind my Summer House, and in the formal garden outside the front of the greenhouse.  
**Lilium is a genus of herbaceous flowering plants grown for their very showy, often fragrant flowers.**  

**Lily flowers are large and come in a range of colors including yellows, whites, pinks, reds, and purples.**  
**They may be planted in early spring or fall.**  
**Both planting times will give flowers in mid to late summer.**  
This Turk’s cap-type lily has white blooms with raised, dark red spots and warm yellow-orange centers.  

**Lilies are native to temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere.**  

The true lilies are erect plants with leafy stems, scaly bulbs, usually narrow leaves, and solitary or clustered flowers.  

**The lily has a diversity of symbolism throughout the world.**  
**In fact, different colored lilies represent different things.**  
**While the white lily represents purity, the spotted tiger lily represents pride or confidence.**  
**In Japan and China, lilies are a traditional symbol of good luck, whereas Greek lore associates the flower with motherhood.**  
These bright white blooms marked with soft yellow centers are so pretty en masse.  

**Here’s a beautiful orange lily growing in my flower garden.**  
**Lilies like to have their “head in the sun, feet in the shade,” and should be planted where they can get at least six hours of full sun per day.**  

**It’s important for their foliage to be exposed to plenty of light --- and not be shaded by other plants.**  

**Over time, most lilies will multiply and the plants will grow into large clumps with many stems, but don’t worry they don’t mind being crowded.**  

Lily flowers consist of six petal-like segments, which may form the shape of a trumpet, with a more or less elongated tube.  
The segments may also be reflexed to form a turban shape, or they may be less strongly reflexed and form an open cup or bowl shape.  

When it comes to water, lilies prefer moist soil but not wet feet.  
**Choose a well-drained site, preferably not too dry.**  

**When cutting flowers, the best time to do it is early in the morning before the sun and wind have a chance to dry the flowers.**  
One can also cut late in the evening after they are rehydrated.  

This one has yet to open.  

**Rose lilies are lush, double-flowered, gorgeous blooms.**  
Their layered blooms are pollen-free and their aroma is pleasantly light.  

**And before bringing them indoors, be sure to gently pull those anthers off of each flower.**  
Pollen is notorious for staining flesh and fabric.  
**Removing the anthers prevents any pollen from getting on the flower petals, which can eat away at the delicate flower parts and shorten the life of the blooms.**  

**When handling lilies, it’s a good idea to wear gloves and clothes you don’t mind getting dirty.**  
**If you happen to get a pollen stain on your clothing, do not rub!**  
**Instead, reach for a roll of tape and use the sticky side to gently dab the area --- the particles will adhere to the tape.**  

**Lilies have one of the longest in-vase lifespans of any cut bloom and the flowers will continue to mature after they’ve been cut.**  

**The cultivation of lilies dates back to 1500 B.C.**  
**Many of the bright colors and forms of lilies were found on botanical expeditions during the 1800s in Asia.**  
**The Chinese and Japanese lily species were exported to Europe and hybridized to create new varieties that are popular today as cut flowers and as garden plants.**  

**Many lilies smell stronger at night.**  
**This is because during the reproduction of lilies, pollen has to get inside the pistil, which usually happens at night and as an immediate response, the fragrance is released.**  

**As the blossoms begin to fade, snip them off to keep the plants looking neat.**  
When all the flowers are spent, remove the entire cluster, but leave the rest of the stem in place.  
**Allow the stem and the leaves to continue growing until they turn yellow in late summer or fall.**  
Then the stems can be cut back to within a couple inches of the soil surface.  

**These lilies will continue blooming through mid-August** --- I am looking forward to enjoying many lily arrangements in the weeks ahead.  
What are your favorite lilies?

**I always enjoy seeing photos from others taken during their vacations, especially when they travel to interesting places.**  

**Not long ago, a member of my outdoor grounds crew, Pasang Sherpa, traveled with his family for one week to Europe --- London, France, and Switzerland.**  
**Pasang, who has many friends in the French Alps region, used to go there every year, but this was his family's first trip.**  
They visited the Jardin Anglais in Geneva, hiked around Chamonix-Mont-Blanc and Sixt-Fer-á-Cheval in France, visited the famous Rouget waterfall, and walked deep into the Grotte de Grace ice cavern.  

Here are a few of his photos, enjoy.  

**Pasang and his family flew at night from New York’s JFK International Airport to London.**  
This is a night view from their plane.  

**Many of you may recognize Pasang from this blog.**  
**He is our resident tree expert here at my farm.**  
**Here he is in London at the beginning of his trip.**  

**One of their big stops was in Geneva, Switzerland.**  
**Here, on the western most tip of Lake Geneva, or Lac Léman, Pasang quickly took a photo of these swans.**  
**Lake Geneva is the largest lake in central Europe, straddling the border between Switzerland and France.**  

**This is the famous flower clock at the Jardin Anglais.**  
**Planted in 1955, it is the biggest clock in the world made exclusively from flowers.**  
**It was built at the park’s centennial to pay homage to Switzerland, watchmaking and horticulture.**  
**The Jardin Anglais is also home to several hundred-year-old trees, such as a ginkgo planted in 1863 and a red beech planted in 1895 for the National Exhibition.**  

**Here’s a photo of Pasang’s daughter, Sonam, and his wife, Ihemi at Jardin Anglais.**

The family also visited Chamonix-Mont-Blanc --- a resort area near the junction of France, Switzerland and Italy.  
**Les Praz is a charming picturesque village just outside the center of Chamonix.**  
**From this vantage point, one can see the beautiful snow-capped mountains in the distance.**  

Another highlight was the a visit to the Grotte de Glace ice cave in Chamonix --- more than 500 steps down.  
**The Grotte de Glace cave is carved into a glacier ...**  

**And all done by man to form the one and only glacier museum in France.**  
**This cave meanders through the Mer de Glace glacier and has many rooms and tunnels.**  

**The cave is reshaped every year and has been for the past half-century, in order to provide safety and interest for visitors.**  

Not far is the Cascade du Rouget – a gorgeous waterfall in Haute-Savoie, in the Sixt-Fer-à-Cheval area.  
Also known as the “Reine des Alpes” or Queen of the Alps, this waterfall has two drops and it’s more than 296 feet.  

**Surrounding the waterfall are these gorgeous views.**  
**The area is just filled with flora and fauna.**  

Among the highest mountains in the area is Mont Buet, also called “Women’s Mont Blanc” which reaches 10,167 feet.  

Sixt-Fer-a-Cheval has miles and miles of trails and paths among alpine meadows, forests, and waterfalls.  

**At the end of their hike, Pasang and his family enjoyed fresh omelettes made right on the hillside.**  

**Followed by a short nap.**  

**And then it was time to hike back to the base.**  
**Pasang and his family enjoy hiking.**  
**In fact, Sherpas live in the most mountainous areas of Nepal, high in the Himalayas.**  
**They are renowned in the international climbing and mountaineering community for their hardiness, expertise, and experience at very high altitudes.**  

**Along the way, the group saw a large herd of sheep grazing.**  

**This photo includes Pasang’s son Tash, Sonam, and Pasang’s brother Dawa, who is a three-time Winter Olympics cross-country skier.**  

**The area around the village of Sixt-Fer-à-Cheval belongs to Sixt-Passy, one of the most beautiful nature reserves of the Haute Savoie.**  
**There are glaciers, high cliffs, waterfalls, alpine meadows, streams, and rivers.**  
Here are Tash and Sonam by one of the ice formations.  

And here is Ihemi in one of the camping “cabins” available to hikers.  
This one is just big enough to sleep in after a long day’s trek.  

**When closed, it is safe from inclement weather and curious animals.**  
**Although the family did not stay on the mountain, they did enjoy a short rest before heading back to the village.**  
**Pasang’s wife and children are already thinking about their next trip abroad.**  
Thanks for sharing your photos, Pasang!

* From:【[Caring for My Growing Tomato Plants](https://www.themarthablog.com/2022/07/caring-for-my-growing-tomato-plants.html)】

**If you’ve ever grown a vining plant, you know how important it is to provide strong structures to which the vines can cling and climb.**  
Using tall, natural bamboo stakes and strong jute twine is a great way to support the growing tomato plants in my garden bed.  

**I am always interested in trying new ways to improve productivity in the gardens.**  
This season, I decided to use eight foot vertical stakes secured to horizontal ones to create our tomato supports.  
**Bamboo is attractive, easy to find, and can be reused year after year.**  
So far, they've been working excellently.  
And yesterday, my outdoor grounds crew foreman, Chhiring Sherpa, tied some of the long vines to the bamboo to keep them all the fast-growing fruits off the ground.  

Here are some photos, enjoy.

**After three weeks of hot, humid, and dry weather, we finally got some much needed rain.**  
**Tomatoes grow best when the daytime temperature is between 65 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit.**  
**They stop growing above 95 degrees Fahrenheit.**  
**Tomatoes also need full sun and warm, well-drained soil.**  
Our tomatoes are thriving and it’s time to support their growing vines.  

In late May, the season’s designated tomato beds are covered in black weed cloth to cut down on some of the laborious weeding in the garden.  
We planted our tomatoes in the back of the garden this year – always as part of our crop rotation practice.  

Our tomato plants are always started from seed over the winter and then transplanted in the ground as soon as daytime temperatures are consistently above 65-degrees Fahrenheit.  
**Two-thirds of the plant should be underground, meaning all but the two top most leaf sets should be buried.**  
**Planting deeply helps the plant to develop more roots, and more roots mean more ability to take up water and nutrients.**  
**If the seedling is already too tall and wobbly, dig a trench instead of a hole and lay the plant on its side.**  
**The stronger root system also helps the plant better survive the hot weather.**  
This applies to tomatoes planted in the ground, in a raised bed or in a container.  

**These are the tomato plants in early June.**  
**With nutrient rich soil and warm days they’ve grown pretty quickly.**  
**Tomatoes, Solanum lycopersicum, have long been one of America’s favorite garden vegetables.**  **Those bold red, sun-ripened tomatoes deliver the taste of summer with every bite.**  
**And, they’re filled with excellent antioxidants and vitamins.**  
**We plant many, many tomatoes, but just a handful of healthy plants can produce a bounty of delicious fruits within eight weeks.**  

I am always trying new methods for staking our tomato plants.  
Every year we try something new and better.  
**I like using bamboo canes.**  
**They are easy to buy in bulk, and can be found in a variety of sizes.**  
**These canes are about eight to nine feet tall.**

**This year, I came up with the idea to make straight supports down each aisle – with no netting, just bamboo.**  
**The first step is to pound the stakes into the ground, so all are the same height along the bed.**

Chhiring places one eight-foot stake every couple of feet along the center of the tomato beds.  
**And each one is about eight to 10-inches deep.**  
The important thing is to place them deep enough, so they remain secure for the duration of the season.  

Next, Chhiring secures horizontal bamboo pieces across all the bamboo stakes.  
He makes four rows about a foot apart going up the bamboo.  

**And then secures them with jute twine.**  
Chhiring secures twine at each joint, so it is tight and strong enough to hold the fruit laden vines.  
**Securing the tomato plants is a time consuming process, but very crucial to good plant growth and performance.**  

Here is one aisle.  
**Look closely, the plants are still quite small, but it won’t take long before they cover the base of the stakes**.  

**Two weeks later, the plants are already several inches taller.**

And yesterday, many were more than two feet tall, with their vines drooping onto the ground.  

Here’s Chhiring measuring and cutting strands of jute twine to the same length.  

**Then he drapes them around his neck as he works to carefully tie up the long tomato vines.**  

First he loops it gently around the vine ...  

And then he secures it to the bamboo crossbar.  
**He ties a simple knot tightly to the bamboo.**  

**And this lifts the vine off the ground.**  
**There is plenty of space to tie and support every tomato vine.**  
**This is the best method we have used yet.**  

Tomato leaves have serrated, or wavy and pointed, edging along the entire perimeter.  
Tomato leaves are compound with multiple leaflets growing along a common stem, called a rachis.  
**These leaves are also slightly fuzzy to the touch, which is caused by the trichomes, or multi-cellular hairs, on the plant.**  
**Never use chemically treated wood or other material for staking climbers, as the chemicals would likely run off and go into the soil.**  

Remember, it’s the yellow flowers produced by tomato plants that must be fertilized before fruit can form.  
**Once fertilized, the flowers develop into tomatoes --- small green globes that become visible at the base of the blossoms and then eventually become mature fruits.**  

**Here are some of the green fruits already growing on the vines.**  
**It’s a good idea to grow several varieties, including at least one or two disease-resistant types, since, of all veggies, tomatoes tend to be the most susceptible to disease.**  
There are several types of tomatoes available, including globe tomatoes used in processing, and for fresh eating.  
Beefsteak are large, often used for sandwiches.  
**Oxheart tomatoes vary in size and are shaped like large strawberries.**  
**Plum tomatoes are usually oblong, and used in tomato sauces.**  
**Cherry tomatoes are small round, often sweet and eaten whole.**  
**Campari tomatoes are sweet and juicy and of small to medium size.**  
**Many of our tomatoes are from Johnny’s Selected Seeds --- a source I’ve been using for many years for both seeds and supplies.**  

**It takes about 50 to 90 days for tomato varieties to reach maturity.**  
**Planting can also be staggered to produce early, mid and late season tomato harvests.**  

**Here are some cherry tomatoes already changing color.**  
**I can’t wait to try the fruits of our labor.**  

**These plants look so much better when kept upright and neat.**  
**The tomato plants have a lot of room to climb, keeping delicious fruits looking their best.**  
**Very soon, we will have many, many tomatoes to enjoy.**  
**I am looking forward to a wonderful harvest this season.**  
**I can almost taste them already!**

* From:【[Displaying Newly Painted Garden Furniture](https://www.themarthablog.com/2022/07/displaying-newly-painted-garden-furniture.html)】

> **Note**  
> The following is copied and pasted.  

**My newly painted outdoor garden furniture looks so wonderful out on my terraces --- a new coat of paint is an easy way to update and transform these metal pieces.**  

Not long ago, I decided to paint a large number of metal furniture pieces my signature "Bedford gray".  
Some of the items were old, weathered, and in need of attention, while others were simply painted the wrong shade or color.  
**It took several days to prime and paint the furniture, and then a few more until everything was completely dry.**  
**Last week, we put them all out where they could be used and enjoyed by visiting family and friends.**  

Here are some photos.

Earlier this month, I gathered all my mismatched, timeworn, metal garden furniture along with some pieces that had been incorrectly painted, and prepared a painting area outside my Winter House carport, so all the furniture could be repainted the same Bedford gray.

Two of my crew – Pete and Fernando --- took on the task of spray painting every piece --- first with a primer made especially for metal and then with an oil based finishing paint.  

**All the pieces looked so great once finished.**  
**Then it was another three days of drying to make sure everything was completely dry.**  
**Drying time is heavily dependent on the surface of the material.**  
**Oil-based paints take longer to dry on metal than on wood or drywall.**  
**There was no rain in the forecast, so it was fine to leave them all drying in my carport.**  

**The first pieces I moved were these benches.**  
**They look so nice outside my Flower Room.**  
It creates a whole new space for rest and contemplation here in this passage way to my Winter House kitchen.  

**Last Friday, Pete and I began moving the rest of the furniture to their new summertime homes.**  

**On this terrace, I placed this charming plant stand.**  
I’m looking forward to filling it with small potted plants from my greenhouse.  

**Have you every seen one of these?**  
**It is called a “conversation chair.”**  
**Over the centuries it has also been known as the courting bench, a tête-à-tête, a chaperone chair, the vis-à-vis, or the gossip chair.**  
It was considered a piece of sophistication and style during the Gilded and Victorian age.  

**Here’s another view.**  
Conceived in 19th century France, the basic setup shows two seats conjoined in a serpentine shape, allowing sitters to have a quiet, more intimate conversation while also preventing too much physical contact because of the shared armrest cleverly doubling as an elegant barrier.  

Over in front of this window is a dainty single chair – also in the same Victorian era style. But look closely ...  

**It is actually in miniature size --- for the youngest of guests.**  

And here is an average sized Victorian style bench --- also painted the same Bedford gray.

In the courtyard behind my Winter House kitchen, Pete and Dawa transport this large plant stand.

**It looks very nice behind this table.**  
**Once the glass tabletop is returned, this will be a great spot for summertime brunches.**  

**Another small table is positioned on the terrace behind my Summer House.**  
These chairs are Francois Carre Sunburst chairs, also known as Pinwheel chairs.  

Nearby is another Sunburst chair sitting behind a small glass covered metal desk looking out at the formal sunken garden.  
**These chairs were made in both France and the United States until the 1940s.**  
**They have a spring mechanism on the seat and backs.**  

**And look at the garden now – so lush and green with all the beautiful foliage.**  
When I first designed this garden, I called it my Boxwood Room.  
It measures 60 by 120 feet.  
**The garden’s focal point is the old Ginkgo tree at the back of the garden.**  
On the sides are smaller ginkgo trees planted over the sculpted boxwood shrubs and hedges.  

**And over on the terrace parterre in front of my Winter House kitchen --- this circular bench, ready for visiting friends and family.**  

**Over on the other side, tables and other seating arrangements --- everything is now all matched and ready for summer entertaining.**  

**One single bench is placed in front of the herb garden with a perfect view of the paddocks and stable beyond.**  
**We are in desperate need of some rain here in the Northeast and in much of the country, but the gardens are looking beautiful this season.**  

**Here is another view over one of two hand-casted antique fountains I purchased many year ago.**  
They are 19th century fountains with a hexagonal shape.  
**I installed them about four years ago and the birds love them.**  
**I hope you are all enjoying your summer and the beauty of your gardens.**

* From:【[Pruning the Hedges Around My Pool](https://www.themarthablog.com/2022/07/pruning-the-hedges-around-my-pool.html)】

> **Note**  
> The following is copied and pasted.  

Another good pruning job is complete at my Bedford, New York farm --- this time, on the hedges surrounding my swimming pool.  

**In 2018, we planted more than 170 purple columnar beech trees, Fagus sylvatica 'Dawyck Purple' along the inside of the pool fence.**  
**The columnar beech is a splendid tree with deep-purple foliage that holds its color all season long.**  
Around the outside of the pool fence, I have a hedge of two dark-colored burgundy-black leafed specimens --- Physocarpus opulifolius ‘Diabolo’ and Cotinus coggygria ‘Royal Purple' shrubs.  
I always try to incorporate unique and interesting plantings into my gardens --- all these have superlative color and appealing form.  
This week, my crew gave the hedges a good pruning to keep them all healthy and looking their best.

Enjoy these photos.

**When planning the gardens around my pool four years ago, I wanted to create a natural border along both sides of my pool fence, so I chose a dark purple color palette.**  
**These Physocarpus and Cotinus shrubs have grown quite a bit since last year – it’s hard to see the beech trees behind them.**  

Here is the inside hedge of columnar beech trees.  
These are fastigiate meaning their branches slope upward more or less parallel to the main stem.  
**I knew these would be perfect around the pool, but like all garden specimens, they must be well-maintained.**  
It was time to prune them all at least a foot.  

The leaves of the columnar purple beech are rounded ellipses, two to four inches long and one to three inches wide, with an undulating margin and a slightly pointed tip.  
**They are smooth and softly lustrous in the sunlight.**  
**In spring the new leaves are a vibrant, deep purple-red.**  
**As they mature in summer they become dark burgundy-purple, holding this color well through the hotter weather.**  

Physocarpus is commonly called ninebark, and is an upright, spreading, somewhat coarse, deciduous, Missouri-native shrub which is closely related to the genus Spiraea.  
**It boasts a deep burgundy foliage with ovate to rounded, usually three to five lobed leaves that are dull green in summer changing to an undistinguished yellow in fall.**  
Then its color veers toward bronzy red by the time the leaves fall in late November.  

**After the white flowers of the physocarpus bloom, what follows are these seed pods – a favorite food of small birds.**

Also known as smoketree or smoke bush, Cotinus is a genus of two species of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae, closely related to the sumacs.  
They are a great choice for massing or for hedges.  
The stunning dark red-purple foliage turns scarlet in autumn and has plume-like seed clusters, which appear after the flowers and give a long-lasting, smoky haze to branch tips.  

In fact, the name “smoke bush” comes from this – the billowy hairs attached to the flower clusters which remain in place through the summer, **turning a smoky pink to purplish-pink.  
I have many smoke bushes around the farm.**  

Here’s Chhiring starting to prune the outside shrubs.  
**Pruning means to lop or cut off any superfluous branches or shoots for better-shape and better growth.**  
**These look fuller every year – in part because of our regular pruning.**  

**Chhiring cuts off any dead or crisscrossing branches first.**  
**The rule of thumb when pruning is to cut the dead, diseased, damaged, non-productive, structurally unsound, or otherwise unwanted plant material.**  
**The branch on the right is dead – it is woody and hollow.**  

**To remove the top, Chhiring uses our STIHL HSA 94 R Hedge Trimmer, which is ideal for making clean pruning cuts.**  

**Chhiring carefully goes over the top of the shrubs with the trimmer keeping them all at the same height as the fence itself.**  

Here’s a look after a section of it is cut --- **it looks so much better**.  

**It doesn’t take long for the ground to fill with clippings.**  
**Once all the pruning is done, Pasang rakes up all the trimmed branches ...**  

**And then loads them all up in our trusted Polaris vehicle, so they can be taken to the compost pile where they will decompose for next year’s garden dressing.**  

**Here’s a view from the other side.**  
They’re the perfect height and still disguises the fence very well --- one cannot see it at all.  

To ensure the pruning is perfectly straight on the beech trees, we always use a landscaping twine, so it is visible and can be pulled taut.  

Here’s a look at one side of the newly pruned beech tree hedge --- so straight all the way around.  

**These trees create such a gorgeous privacy screen around my pool.**  

**I wanted the pool to look as natural as possible where I could enjoy the panoramic views of the landscape with my family and friends.**  
At the far end of the pool I have five staddle stones.  
Staddle stones were originally used in the 17th and 18th centuries as support bases for granaries, hayricks, and game larders.  
**They typically looked like giant stone mushrooms, but mine are square –-- a more rare and unique version.**  

**The pool is so inviting.**  
**This is one of my favorite summertime areas of the farm.**  
**And the perfect place to cool off --- it’s expected to be a very hot, humid week ahead.**

* From:【[My Vegetable Gardens in Mid-July](https://www.themarthablog.com/2022/07/my-vegetable-gardens-in-mid-july.html)】

It's going to be another dry, humid day here at my Bedford, New York farm with temperatures in the high 80s.  
**We haven't had any rain at all for at least two weeks - hopefully we'll get some soon.**  

**Despite the uncomfortable summer weather and lack of precipitation, the vegetables are thriving, and the gardens are looking excellent.**  
**It's so much fun to visit right now because of all the growing produce --- there’s something new popping up every day.**  
We have broccoli, cauliflower, artichokes, lettuce, peas, fava beans, Swiss chard, peppers, cilantro, and so much more.  

Enjoy these photos.  

**Here is one side of my vegetable garden down by the chicken coops.**  
The vegetable gardens are entirely fenced in to protect the crops from hungry creatures.  
**I try different configurations every year to see which ones work best for what we are growing.**  
**I like to use the most amount of space possible for planting.**  

Swiss chard is a leafy green vegetable often used in Mediterranean cooking.  
**The leaf stalks are large and vary in color, usually white, yellow, or red.**  
The leaf blade can be green or reddish in color.  
**This year, the Swiss chard is near the front entrance of this garden.**  

**We’ve already harvested many beans.**  
Bush beans are second only to tomatoes as the most popular vegetables in home gardens.  
Bush beans, or snap beans, are eaten when the seeds are small.  
They are also called string beans because of a fibrous string running the length of the pod, but most varieties grown now do not have that fibrous string.  
**Purple beans are so pretty –-- violet-purple outside and bright green inside with great flavor.**  

**We’re always growing lettuce.**  
Lettuce, Lactuca sativa, is a cultivated plant of the daisy family, Asteraceae.  
**Lettuce is a fairly hardy, cool-weather vegetable that thrives when the average daily temperature is between 60 and 70-degrees Fahrenheit.**  
**We always grow several varieties.**  

**In one garden along the fence we have lots of peas** --– one section for shelling peas, which need to be removed from their pods before eating, and another for edible pods, which can be eaten whole, such as our snap peas.  
They are best grown on supports to keep them off the ground and away from pests and diseases.  

**By early July every year, these peas are plump, and ready to be picked.**  
The pea, Pisum sativum, is an annual herbaceous legume in the family Fabaceae.  
**The pods can range in size from four to 15-centimeters long and about one-and-a-half to two-and-a-half centimeters wide.**  
**Each pod contains between two and 10-peas.**  

**The onions look wonderful too.**  
We planted a lot of white, yellow and red onions.  
**Onions are harvested later in the summer when the underground bulbs are mature and flavorful.**  
**I always look forward to the onion harvest!**  

Kale or leaf cabbage is a group of vegetable cultivars within the plant species Brassica oleracea.  
**They have purple or green leaves, in which the central leaves do not form a head.**  

**Look at our bed of kale – very pretty with ruffled leaves and a purple-green color.**  
**One cup of chopped kale has 134-percent of the recommended daily intake of vitamin-C --- that’s more than a medium orange, which only has 113-percent of the daily C requirement.**  

**Broccoli is a hardy vegetable of the cabbage family that is high in vitamins A and D.**  
**And, according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service, USDA, the average American eats more than four-pounds of broccoli a year.**  
**Because broccoli is a cold weather crop.**  
**The recent warmer weather causes it to bolt, or go to flower sooner, but these heads are looking terrific.**  

**Cauliflower is filled with nutrients.**  
**They hold plenty of vitamins, such as C, B, and K.**  
**Cauliflower is ready to harvest when the heads are six to eight inches in diameter.**  
**When picking, cut the stalk just below the head, leaving a stem of about two inches long.**

**Our cabbages are growing nicely.**  
**To get the best health benefits from cabbage, it’s good to include all three varieties into the diet – Savoy, red, and green.**  
Savoy cabbage leaves are ruffled and a bit yellowish in color.  

Here’s a perfect artichoke ready to pick.  
**Globe artichokes, Cynara scolymus, are popular in both Europe and the United States.**  
Artichokes are actually flower buds, which are eaten when they are tender.  

See how it grows on its stem?  
**When harvesting, always use sharp pruners and carefully cut them from the plant leaving an inch or two of stem.**  
**Artichokes have very good keeping qualities and can remain fresh for at least a week.**  

**There is also a lot of fresh and fragrant cilantro.**  
**Often known in the United Kingdom as coriander, cilantro comes from the plant Coriandrum sativum. ** 
**In the United States, the leaves of the plant are referred to as cilantro and the seeds are called coriander.**  
**Cilantro is also commonly known as Chinese parsley.**  

**Vicia faba, also known as the broad bean or fava bean is an ancient member of the pea family.**  
**They have a nutty taste and buttery texture.**  
**I always grow lots of fava beans.**  
**We used many fava beans from my garden at my 20-year plus party last week here at the farm.**

Basil, also called great basil, is a culinary herb of the family Lamiaceae.  
**Basil is native to tropical regions from central Africa to Southeast Asia.**  
It is a tender plant, and is used in cuisines worldwide.  
**Since basil grows in tropical climates, it grows well in hot weather.**  
**Actually, this plant can thrive in very warm temperatures, and it grows amazingly well up to 90 degrees Fahrenheit.**  

Also always growing here – parsley.  
This will find its way into my morning green juice.  
**Parsley is rich in vitamins K, C, and other antioxidants.**  
It has a bright, herbaceous, and slightly bitter taste.  

This is curly parsley.  
**This comes from the same family, but curly parsley leaves are thicker and ruffled.**  
Some also say its flavor is a bit stronger in curly parsley than in the flat-leaf varieties.

**Our herbs are planted in the center of the garden.**  
Thyme is an herb whose small leaves grow on clusters of thin stems.  
**It is a Mediterranean herb with dietary, medicinal, and ornamental uses.**  
Fragrant variegated thyme is green with white leaves.  
**It is delicious with fish or poultry and imparts a lemony flavor.**  

And here is Moises weeding the areas beneath our tomato plants.  
I like to use bamboo canes for my tomatoes.  
**They’re easy to buy in bulk, and can be found in a variety of sizes.**  
They should be seven to eight foot tall stakes that are at least an inch in diameter.  
Staking is the best way to ensure the plants get the support they need for the many vegetables they will produce this season.  

**Look at these beautiful young tomatoes.**  
There are already so many growing.  
**Most tomatoes are red, but other colors are possible, including green, yellow, orange, pink, black, brown, white and purple.**  
**We’ll be harvesting a lot of tomatoes later this summer.**  

We always extend the harvest season by re-planting in two-week successions.  
**Succession planting is the practice of following one crop with another to maximize a garden’s yield. It is an efficient use of gardening space and time.**  
**Everyone always asks what I do with all the vegetables I grow.**  
**I share them with my family, but I also love sharing the bounty with friends, colleagues, and my hardworking crew here at the farm.**  
**I provide fruits, vegetables, and eggs for magazine and video shoots.**  
**And, of course, all my birds get vegetables too.**  
I hope your gardens are doing well – share their progress with me in the section below.

* From:【[Trimming the Summer House Hornbeam Hedge](https://www.themarthablog.com/2022/07/trimming-the-summer-house-hornbeam-hedge.html)】

Pruning at my farm continues at the long hedge that runs in front of my Summer House and along the road behind my Winter House.

**The hornbeam, Carpinus, is deciduous and very fast-growing.**  
**In fact, it can grow about four to five feet per year.**  
I always keep a close eye on all the hornbeams.  
Earlier this week, the crew tackled the hornbeam hedges in front of my main greenhouse.  
It's quite a task to get all of them trimmed properly, but the end result is well worth the effort.  

Enjoy these photos.

Next on our long list of pruning projects is to prune the hornbeam hedge along the back of the Summer House and the Winter House.  
This is a European hornbeam hedge, Carpinus betulus.  
**Because it is planted on a gradual slope, it needs to be pruned using a step method.**  

It is quite pretty in this location, but it also serves as a good privacy barrier from the road.  
**The top and upper sides of a hedge are exposed to lots of light, so they grow more vigorously.**  

From this angle it is easy to see all the growth from the past year.  
**We trim these hornbeams annually.**  
**If left unpruned, hedges start to look tatty and lose their desired shape.**  

**These round hornbeams in front of my Summer House entrance also need trimming.**  

The European hornbeam is related to the beech tree, with a similar leaf shape;  
however, on the hornbeam, the leaves are actually smaller and more deeply furrowed.  
**They become golden yellow to orange before falling in autumn.**  

As with all the hornbeams, the crew does most of the pruning by hand.  
It takes longer, but it looks much better in the end.  
These are Okatsune 30-inch long Hedge Shears.  
**Okatsune shears are light and precise and come in a range of sizes.**  

Pasang does all he can from the ground first and works his way up.  

I prefer the straight edge finish that is done when using Japanese shears.  
**An important tip is to use the sharpest tools possible to avoid unnecessary damage and stress to the hedge.**  
**Their large leaves can turn brown if not cut properly.**  

**Here, the front of the hedge is trimmed – it’s looking better already.**  
**Carpinus betulus is a hornbeam native to Western Asia and central, eastern and southern Europe, including southern England.**  
Because of its dense foliage and tolerance to being cut back, this hornbeam is popularly used for hedges and topiaries.  

Here is a view looking up.  
**One can see what has been trimmed and what there is still left to do.**  
**Hornbeams do best in rich, moist, well-drained soils. ** 
**All this growth shows how healthy the soil is at the farm.**  

For the top of the hedge section, Chhiring and Pasang use our STIHL HLA 85 battery powered extended hedge trimmer.  
**It’s light, easy to maneuver and cuts extremely well.**  

**The blades of this STIHL HL85 also have double-sided cutting blades that cut in both directions.**

In this image, one can see the top going down the length of cut hornbeam – it is very level.  

And looking down, here are all the clippings ready to be raked and taken to the compost pile.  

This is the back of the hedge – also completely pruned.  

**And here is the finished front of the hedge – all neat and tidy.**  
Deer do eat hornbeams, but since the property is completely fenced, it isn’t a problem here at Cantitoe.  

**The hedge looks great from all sides.**  
**It is important to keep up with the care and maintenance of all plantings.**  
Proper pruning can remove any portions that have disease, fungi, and other types of decay.  
It also exposes the inner foliage to more sunlight and air circulation, which helps to reduce the chance of disease.  

The hornbeams opposite the long hedge were also pruned and groomed.  
Here is one finished side facing my Winter House courtyard.  


After the entire task is done, Chhiring and Pasang rake all the fallen leaves and branches.  
Chhiring uses a soft rake to carefully remove debris that has fallen into the pachysandra in front of the round hornbeams.  

Here, Pasang carries a load to the cage of the Hi-Lo.

One of our favorite tools here at the farm is our STIHL backpack blower.  
We’ve been using STIHL’s blowers for years.  
These blowers are powerful and fuel-efficient.  
**The gasoline-powered engines provide enough rugged power to tackle heavy debris while delivering much lower emissions.**  

And here is the front of my Summer House.  
It is always so nice to see these great hornbeams trimmed and sculpted.  
Next, it’s time for a big drink.  
**We’ve had a week without any rain.**  
**I hope some rain comes soon**, but in the meantime, our professional adjustable circular tripod sprinkler from Gilmour does an excellent job.

* From:【[Picking Colorful and Fragrant Sweet Peas](https://www.themarthablog.com/2022/07/picking-colorful-and-fragrant-sweet-peas.html)】

**The colorful and fragrant sweet pea flowers are blooming so beautifully at my Bedford, New York farm this season.**  

**The sweet pea, Lathyrus odoratus, is a garden classic - producing beautiful blossoms with the most amazing scent.**  
Sweet pea seeds can be sown into small pots of compost in autumn and overwintered indoors, or planted directly into the ground come spring.  
We planted ours along the fence in my vegetable garden and some on the fence of my flower cutting garden.  
**And, over the last couple of weeks we've picked bunches of gorgeous sweet-smelling flowers to decorate my home.**  

Enjoy these photos.  

**The old-fashioned varieties of sweet pea are grown for their vibrant colors and intense fragrances.**  
**Most sweet peas will begin blooming in late spring or early summer.**  

**This one is a bright salmon to peach color.**  
**Originating in the southwest of Italy and the islands of the Mediterranean, sweet pea has been cultivated for use in gardens since the 17th century.**  

The flowers feature one large, upright rounded petal, two narrow side petals, and two lower petals.  
**Luckily, the stems are sturdy enough to hold up their profuse flowers.**  
Here’s a light lavender and white variety.  

**We planted sweet peas along the fence of the vegetable garden.**  
**Sweet peas work well here, attracting bees and other pollinators needed for the vegetables.**  

**The leaves are pinnate with two leaflets and a terminal tendril, which twines around supporting plants and structures, helping the sweet pea to climb.**  

Here are the tendrils they use to grasp anything that’s a quarter-inch or less.  

**Sweet peas offer one of the widest color ranges in the plant kingdom, including crimson reds, navy blues, pastel lavenders, pinks, and the purest whites.**  
These colors are found as solid colors, bicolors, and streaked or flaked flowers.  

**To keep the vine productive, it’s a good idea to cut flowers frequently and remove the faded blossoms.**  
Some varieties tolerate heat better than others, so check the seed packets carefully when planting.  

This crisp white one grows along the fence of my flower garden.  
White sweet peas are very reliable performers.  
**As annuals, sweet peas thrive in full sun, although in warmer climates they do well in a location that receives partial sun, especially in the heat of the afternoon.**  

**Sweet peas prefer rich but well-drained soil.**  
**A slightly alkaline soil pH of about 7.5 is ideal for sweet peas.**  

Here in my Winter House are several freshly cut bunches of sweet peas.  

Once they are ready to be arranged, Enma removes each bunch and places them in a small tub of water keeping like colors together.  

**She gathers them one stem at a time holding them securely in one hand while she positions them with the other – blossoms faced out.**  

**Here are the most beautiful salmon colored sweet peas.**  

**After selecting a good amount of flowers, Enma cuts the stems with a very sharp scissor leaving them about six to eight inches long.**  
When trimming, always keep in mind the size of the container.  

**Then Enma places them in the vase of cool water – they look so beautiful with their green straight stems.**  

Here, one can see the stems with at least a few inches below the water line.  
For the longest vase life, pick sweet peas when there are at least two unopened flowers at the tip of a stem.  


Enma does the same with the other bunches, taking each flower and facing the open blooms outward so they look best.  
**While sweet peas fill any room with sweet fragrance, they are a short-lived cut flower, lasting only four to five days in a vase.**  

This variety is flecked and shows such pretty purple and white blossoms.  
The first sweet peas were introduced to Britain in 1699 when a Sicilian monk, Francis Cupani, sent seeds to Dr.Robert Uvedale, a teacher from Enfield, Middlesex.  
They became hugely popular in North America, both as garden plants and cut blooms.  
By the late 1800s, growers in the US shipped trainloads of sweet peas all over the country.  

Here is a bunch of solid colored pink sweet peas.  
**To prolong the cut flowers, change the water in the vase once or twice a day, and place the vase of flowers out of direct sunlight and away from drafts.**  

And here are the cut pink and white sweet peas.  

Once all cut, these flowers make a gorgeous arrangement –-- and I wish you could smell them;  
**the fragrance is intoxicating.**  
**I hope you are able to enjoy the beauty of some cut sweet pea flowers in your home this season.**

* From:【[Repainting My Outdoor Metal Furniture](https://www.themarthablog.com/2022/07/repainting-my-outdoor-metal-furniture-2.html)】

> **Note**  
> The following is copied and pasted.  

**A new coat of paint can totally refresh and transform a piece of outdoor furniture.**  

Now that it's summer and we're able to do a lot more entertaining at home, I decided to have some of the crew work on a rather large project - repainting a number of outdoor metal furniture pieces one uniform color, Bedford Gray.  
Some of the items were old, weathered, and in need of attention, while others were simply the wrong shade or color.  
The first step was to designate a safe painting space.  
Then, the furniture pieces needed to be primed, dried, and finally painted with an oil-based enamel finish.  
**This project took several days to complete, but I am happy with the final results and every piece looks great.**  

Enjoy these photos.

**All the furniture to be painted was brought to the driveway in front of my Winter House carport.**  
These pieces are fine, but I wanted them all finished in my signature color, Bedford Gray.  

Some pieces were mismatched and in their original colors from when they were purchased.  

**And some of the pieces were a bit rusted and timeworn.**

In one corner of the driveway, we put up a pergola from one of my previous outdoor collections and covered it with plastic sheeting.  
**These plastic drop cloths come in a range of sizes and are available at most hardware stores.**  

Here’s Fernando securing the plastic to the frame using spring clamps.  
At the bottom, Fernando weighted the plastic covers with bricks.  

**Meanwhile, Carlos cleans all the furniture with a damp cloth, so the paint can be applied smoothly.**  
**Fortunately, the week’s weather forecast was perfect for this project.**  
**Ideally, temperatures should be between 50 degrees and 90 degrees Fahrenheit, and relative humidity below 85 percent.**  

Pete begins to prime the first chair.  
**It’s important to coat the furniture with a good quality metal primer and to coat everything completely as bare metal rusts quickly.**  
**It’s also a good idea to practice on a piece of scrap cardboard first to get the vertical and horizontal spraying movements consistent before painting the real piece.**  

**Pete puts several chairs together so as to conserve the primer and allow the spray to coat more than one chair at a time.**  
Always spray the object using an even side-to-side motion with each pass overlapping the spray pattern by about one-third.  

**For this job, we needed a strong air compressor.**  
**Air compressors work by forcing air into a container and pressurizing it and then pushing it out though the tank and the paint sprayer.**  

**The inside of this trough needed to be sanded first to create a smooth surface for better adhesion.**  

Here’s one chair all primed – in Bedford Gray.  

By afternoon, most of the pieces were also primed.  
**The primer dries very fast.**  

Next – paint.  
It’s crucial to use a high-quality oil-based spray paint specifically designed for outdoor use to prevent rust.  

**Fernando pours the paint into the sprayer’s reservoir.**  
**The color is just right.**  

And then one by one each piece is sprayed.  
**Always use a mask even when working outdoors.**  
**When spray painting indoors, always ventilate the room well by opening windows and doors.**  

When spray painting, use thin, multiple coats instead of one thick coat to get the best result.  

**Look how smooth this chair seat is after painting.**  

And here’s the trough all finished.  
**It looks so much better.**  

**The furniture is left to dry completely inside the carport for at least 24 hours.**  

**And once it’s dry, it’s ready to be used.**  
**Here are two newly painted benches in front of my Flower Room just around the corner from my carport.**  
**I think they look great in this space.**  
**I am excited to place all the furniture out for the season.**  
**Old pieces made to look like new** …  
it’s a good thing!

* From:【[July Flowers in My Cutting Garden](https://www.themarthablog.com/2022/07/july-flowers-in-my-cutting-garden.html)】

My flower cutting garden continues to produce beautiful blooms.  

**This cutting garden has developed so well over the last few seasons.**  
**I enjoy comparing its progress from year to year and seeing where I need to add more plants to improve the display.**  
**It takes a lot of time to maintain a flower cutting garden this large.**  
**We are constantly weeding and watering, particularly during these warm summer months.**  
**This time of year, I have many Shasta daisies, balloon flowers, Black-Eyed Susans, yarrow, sweet peas, and more.**  

Enjoy these photos.  

**All these flowers are thriving in my cutting garden** – there is always something new to see every time I walk through the beds.  
These are Shasta daisies.  
**I have an abundance of shasta daisies this season – they always look so cheerful, especially when planted in large groups.**  

Shasta daisy flowers provide perky summer blooms with the look of the traditional daisies along with evergreen foliage.  
**They are low maintenance and great for filling in bare spots in the landscape.**  

**These are the showy flowers of rudbeckia.**  
Rudbeckia’s bright, summer-blooming flowers give the best effect when planted in masses in a border or wildflower meadow.  

**In general, rudbeckias are relatively drought-tolerant and disease-resistant.**  
**Flower colors include yellow and gold, and the plants grow two to six feet tall, depending on the variety.**  

Here is one of many kinds of lilies that bloom in my flower garden.  
I also have lilies along my winding pergola, outside my Winter House kitchen and in the sunken garden behind my Summer House.  
My collection of lilies is a combination of Oriental, Asiatic, trumpet, and Orienpet lilies.  

**Lilies come in a variety of colors with multiple blooms per stem.**  

**I also have many different irises in this garden.**  
**Iris flowers can begin blooming in late winter to early spring.**  
Iris care is minimal once the growing iris is established.  
Iris flowers bloom in shades of purple, blue, white, and yellow and include many hybridized versions that are multi-colored.  

Lady’s mantle, Alchemilla vulgaris, grows along both sides of the main footpath of my cutting garden.  
**In late spring and early summer, the plant produces lovely chartreuse colored blooms.**  


Close to the footpath is this attractive Nasturtium.  
Nasturtium plants, Tropaeolum, are loved for their rich, saturated, jewel-toned colors.  
**Planted in the spring they are fast and easy to grow.**  
Nasturtium is a genus of about 80 species of annual and perennial herbaceous flowering plants.  
**It was named by Carl Linnaeus in his book Species Plantarum.**  
**These flowers can vary in shade, but the most popular versions are orange, yellow, pink, red, or mahogany.**  

**Nasturtium leaves are small to medium in size and round and broad in shape.**  
The flat, bright green leaves are waxy, pliable, have a few veins running throughout, and are connected to a central stem.  

These are the large leaves of Rodgersia – a genus of flowering plants in the Saxifragaceae family. **Rodgersia are herbaceous perennials originating from east Asia.**  
The common name is Roger’s Flower.  

Achillea millefolium, commonly known as yarrow, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.  
**It is a hardy perennial with fernlike leaves and colorful blooms.**  
The large, flat-topped flower clusters are perfect for cutting and drying.  

**The flower clusters or corymbs are made up of dozens of tiny daisy-like florets.**  
**Here’s yarrow in light pink.**  
**Yarrow flower colors range from white and soft pastels to brilliant shades of yellow, red, orange, and gold.**  

**Butterfly weed is a bright orange showy native wildflower that’s easy to grow, cold hardy, and does well in poor, dry soils.**  
Long-lasting clusters of small, flat-topped flowers are crowned with a yellow, sun-kissed “corona” and **blooms from June through August**.  
**Butterfly weed is an important nectar source for Monarch butterflies and its leaves provide essential food for developing Monarch caterpillars.**  

**Many of the poppies are still going strong.**  
**Poppies require very little care, whether they are sown from seed or planted when young – they just need full sun and well-drained soil.**  

**Poppies are an attractive, easy to grow flower in both annual and perennial varieties, and they come in nearly every color of the rainbow.**  

Here is a poppy seed pod, which is what’s left on the stem once the flower blooms and the petals fall off.  
**As the seed heads turn brown with ripeness, it’s time to cut them and harvest the seeds.**  
One can tell when pods are ripe by shaking the stem.  
If the pod rattles, it’s ready.  

**There are still a few foxgloves here too.**  
Here is a tall foxglove plant, Digitalis purpurea.  
These add lovely vertical interest to any garden.  
**Foxglove flowers grow on stems which may reach up to six feet in height, depending on the variety.**

**The phlox is thriving in the garden.**  
**Phlox has superb heat and mildew resistance.**  
Phlox is a tall and upright grower that’s great for the back of the border, or even planted at the edge of the garden among the shrubs.  
**Phlox also comes in a range of colors from pure white to lavender to even red, and grows happily in most parts of the country.**  
**If properly planted and sited, phlox is largely pest and disease free too – a perfect perennial.**  

This is a balloon flower, Platycodon grandiflorus – a species of herbaceous flowering perennial plant of the family Campanulaceae, and the only member of the genus Platycodon.  
**It is native to East Asia and is also known as the Chinese bellflower or platycodon.**  
**The opened flowers resemble those of bellflowers, and while most are deep blue or purple, white and pink varieties are also available.**  

Balloon flowers get their name from the unopened buds, which swell up prior to opening and resemble little hot-air balloons.  

And growing on one side of the fence surrounding the garden are these dainty perennial sweet pea or everlasting pea flowers.  
**The sweet pea is a herbaceous climbing vine with beautiful bright flowers that grow up to 10 feet long.**  
**I hope your garden is also doing wonderfully this season.**  
**Share what blooms you are growing in the comments section below.**  
**Have a great week.**

> **Note**  
> The following is copied and pasted.  

**Entertaining at my Bedford, New York farm is always so much fun, especially when I host momentous occasions.**  

**Yesterday, I invited more than 60 people for dinner to celebrate all those who have worked with me for 20-years or longer.**  
Our feast centered around an Argentinian theme with foods prepared on an asado grill by Chef Pablo Calandroni - whole salmon, rib eye steak, beef short ribs, pork spare ribs, sweetbreads, chicken, and morcilla sausages.  
My friend Chef Pierre Schaedelin of PS Tailored Events also prepared a variety of delicious fresh salads - Spanish criolla salad, black bean salad, three-color carrot slaw, potato salad, beet salad, and my daughter's flavorful chopped salad with corn and jalapeño.  
**Everything was so delicious, everyone went back for seconds and even thirds.**  
For dessert - refreshing fruit ice pops, shortbread cookies, and tres leches cupcakes.  

Here are some photos, enjoy.  

It was a beautiful summer evening for a party.  
For this gathering, I decided to have a sit-down dinner for all 64 guests.  
We used green and grayish tan linens and my Drabware plates for the long table.  

For the centerpieces, we placed potted herbs down the entire length of the table.  
**I bought the chairs years ago during my catering days – 450 wicker chairs and they still come in so handy for these large parties.**  
**Each longtime employee had a small gift from me at their place setting.**  

Here is my outdoor grounds crew foreman, Chhiring Sherpa, with his son, Mingmar, and his wife Pema.  
**This day was Chhiring’s actual 20th anniversary working with me at the farm.**  

**Video editor, Paul Delmiche, is another longtime colleague who started with me in our Westport television studio in 1997.**  
**Here he is with line producer, Jon Coniglio, who has also been with me for a number of years.**  

Here’s Lorna Aragon and her sister, Elizabeth.  
Lorna has been with me for more than 20-years – working with our flagship magazine, Living.  
Lorna oversaw the table setting for this event.  

**Many of you may recognize my longtime food editor, Sarah Carey, who has been with me for more than 20-years.**  
**Here she is with her wife, Maryann Vanderventer, who also worked with me on my television show.**  

**Before dinner I welcomed everyone to Cantitoe Corners and thanked all the longtime celebrants for their years of hard work and dedication to my farm, my company, and my brand.**  

**Not far from the table was the giant asado grill filled with so many delicious foods.**  
**The charcoal was lighted three hours earlier to get it perfectly hot for cooking.**  

**Asado chef, Pablo Calandroni, and his sous chef, Kevin Thomas, cut all the meats for the buffet as soon as they were done cooking.**  

**These chaffing dishes are heated with charcoal from the grill.**  
**Each one held a different meat – everything was so delicious.**  

**Here is a first helping – a little bit of everything cooked so perfectly.**  

**Kevin and Pablo stopped for this quick photo.**  
Be sure to see more of Pablo’s great feasts on his Instagram page @asado.561.  

**My executive manager, Dorian Arrich, smiles for this photo with Fernando Ferrari, who has worked for all my television and video programs and shoots for more than 25 years.**  

**The salads were all so beautiful and delicious.**  
**Chef Pierre used vegetables from my gardens to make them.**  
**We also had corn on the cob.**  

This is my daughter Alexis’s chopped salad with corn and jalapeño.  
**It takes a bit of time to dice all the ingredients, but it is so worth it.**  

And look at this gorgeous deep red beet salad.  
**The beets were harvested from my garden just the day before.**  

We also served cocktails – margaritas and sangria.  
**Here is our excellent wait staff.**  

And of course, we enjoyed lots of Martha’s Chard, my new chardonnay with 19Crimes.  
On the left is Snoop Dogg’s Cali Rose, also a big favorite.  

For dessert, ice pops served in individual cups – currant, black raspberry, coconut, peach, lemon, and red raspberry.  
**It was hard to choose just one.**  

**Sarah Carey made these delectable tres leches cupcakes with candied orange slices.**  

**And my favorite brown butter shortbread cookies – dessert was so perfect.**  

**Each employee gift was wrapped in the same blue and white of the Argentinian flag to go along with our theme.**  

I gave Bandolier phone cases – the original luxury crossbody leather case.  
**Practical and functional, I’ve been using them for several years and love all the different styles and colors.**  
**It was a perfect evening and perfect party with friends.**  
**And, you’ll soon be able to watch me make some of the dishes from this party on Roku!**

> **Note**  
> The following is copied and pasted.  

**Today at my Bedford, New York farm, I'm hosting a very special party to celebrate all those who have worked with me for 20-years and more.**  

With so much to do, everyone pitched in yesterday to get everything ready.  
**Among the many tasks on our list - mow the lawns, weed the garden beds, mulch the carriage roads, harvest the vegetables, bathe the donkeys, and make the tablecloth and centerpieces for the outdoor sit-down dinner.**  
**We got so much done and fortunately this week's weather is fantastic.**  

Here are some photos, enjoy.  

My peafowl have the perfect “bird’s eye view” of all the party preparations going on at the farm.  
Here are three sitting atop one of the chickens coops “taking it all in.”  

The courtyard is where everyone will gather – it is looking so pretty with the large potted sago palms on the cobblestone courtyard.  

**All the surrounding areas near the stable are freshly groomed.**  
**Here’s Domi mowing the lawn in front of the peafowl and goose enclosures.**  

**Nearby, my stable manager, Helen, wipes down all the stall doors.**  

**My vegetable garden is looking so lush and green.**  
**It was also cleaned and weeded.**  

**These beets were harvested early in the day.**  
The beetroot is the taproot of the beet plant, and is often called the table beet, garden beet, red or golden beet or simply… beet.  
**Beets are highly nutritious and very good for maintaining strong cardiovascular health.**  
**It’s low in calories, contains zero cholesterol, and is rich in folates, vitamin-A, B-complex, and antioxidants.**  

**Vicia faba, also known as the broad bean or fava bean is an ancient member of the pea family.**  
**They have a nutty taste and buttery texture.**  
**I always grow lots of fava beans.**  
A trug bucket full is also picked for the party.  

**And here’s a bowl of fresh eggs from my gorgeous and most productive chickens.**  

Herbs are potted for use as our centerpieces.  
**It is always nice to utilize natural elements to decorate the tables.**  
**Green is also a theme color for the table setting.**  
It will go so nicely with my Drabware dishes.  


**Dawa is weeding the perennial garden across from the chicken coops** --– it’s all hands on deck for this special gathering.  

**And of course, the donkeys are getting bathed for the occasion.**  

**Truman “TJ” Junior and Clive don’t seem to mind – these baths cool them down on a warm summer’s day.**  

Here’s Domi carefully weed whacking around the antique posts of the Asian pear espalier.  
**I bought these posts from China.**  
Originally, they were used as grape supports in a valley that was going to be dammed and flooded to create a reservoir.  
**Now, I use these beautiful posts for various projects around my farm --– including this row of espaliered fruits**.  

**Inside my Flower Room kitchen, Chef Pierre Schaedelin from PS Tailored Events, cuts the beets into bite-sized pieces for a delicious salad.**  

**Here’s sous chef Moises carrying a tray filled with citrus --– ready for the cocktails and fruit popsicles.**  

**Phurba puts fresh mulch around the boxwood in the long Boxwood Allée.**  
**Mulch is a layer of material applied to the soil surface.**  
**It helps to conserve soil moisture, improve fertility and health of the soil, reduce weed growth, and enhance the visual appeal of the area.**  
All the organic mulch we use is made right here at the farm.  

**The peafowl have moved for a closer look --- here they are on top of the mulch filled dump truck.**  

**Here, Chhiring, who is celebrating his 20 years with me today, is burning all the pesky weeds that grow in between the cobblestone pavers.**  

Lorna unrolls the fabric to make our handmade tablecloths.  
I chose this dark gray color --– it will look so pretty with the Drabware and herb centerpieces.  

**And here’s a tray of homemade currant fruit popsicles ready for the freezer.**  

**We’re almost set for our fun summertime party!**  
**And I think the peafowl approve.**  
**This peahen is sitting on the rim of a giant stone birdbath in front of my Stable Office building --– she is so interested and curious.**  
**I’ll be sure to share more photos of this party in my next blog – stay tuned.**

* From:【[Summer Pruning for My Hornbeam Hedges](https://www.themarthablog.com/2022/07/summer-pruning-for-my-hornbeam-hedges.html)】

> **Note**  
> The following is copied and pasted.  

**My tall English hornbeam hedges always look so beautiful after a fresh pruning.**  

This week, my outdoor grounds crew trimmed the hornbeam hedges in front of my main greenhouse --- the hedges surrounding part of my formal lily garden beds and the large sculpted hedge nearby.  
**Botanically known as Carpinus betulus, the hornbeam is a fast growing deciduous tree that can grow up to several feet per year.**  
**I like to maintain the hedges using a traditional European style of pruning, so they have a nice, sculpted appearance.**  
**This means, it’s crucial that they be trimmed regularly, so they don’t look overgrown and unruly.**  

Here are some photos.  

**This tall hornbeam hedge grows at the edge of the gravel topped parking area directly in front of my main greenhouse.**  
**It is quite pretty here, but serves primarily as a privacy and noise barrier from the road.**  
**This photo was taken before any pruning began – one can see all the lush new growth.**  

**With proper care, the hornbeam grows quickly, so it is important to trim and sculpt it regularly.**  
**Hornbeam is also very hardy and frost resistant, which is good in this area.**  

**Carpinus betulus is native to Western Asia and central, eastern, and southern Europe, including southern England.**  
Because of its dense foliage and tolerance to being cut back, this hornbeam is popularly used for hedges and topiaries.  
**Hornbeams are often confused with the common beech because of their similar leaves;**  
**however, the hornbeam leaves are actually smaller and more deeply furrowed than beech leaves.**  
The leaves are deciduous and alternate, with serrated margins.  

**Looking inside the hedge, the hornbeam has pale grey bark with vertical markings.**  
All of these hornbeams are planted in a very straight line just a couple feet apart.  
**One can see the sturdy branches and how they grow outward and slightly upward.**  

**The crew does most of the pruning by hand.**  
**Everyone uses Japanese Okatsune shears specially made for trimming hedges.**  
**These shears are user friendly, and come in a range of sizes.**  

**It is more time consuming to trim these hedges by hand, but it is also more exact and provides straight clean cuts – very important when sculpting formal hedges.**  

**We trim the hornbeams every year around this time.**  
**Pasang keeps the shears close to shoulder level.**  
This allows the best control.  
He also holds the shears closer to the base of the blades.  

**Here, one can see what has been cut and what hasn’t.**  

It doesn’t take long for the ground to fill with clippings --– and this is just from the front of the hedge.  

Once the front of the hedge is done, our Hi-Lo is moved in, so Pasang could trim the uppermost sections and the top.  
**The Hi-Lo is very useful, and because the hedge is accessible from the parking area, it always comes in handy for this task.**  

Manning the Hi-Lo is my outdoor grounds crew foreman, Chhiring Sherpa.  
**He’s been working with me here at the farm for 20-years!**  
He positions the Hi-Lo and its cage and makes sure Pasang can safely reach what he is pruning.  

The top of this hedge section is trimmed perfectly level using our STIHL HLA 85 battery powered extended hedge trimmer.  
It’s light, easy to maneuver and cuts extremely well.  

**Once an area is trimmed, Pasang uses a soft rake to clear the top of any cut branches and leaves.**  

**Next, he uses a long bamboo stake to ensure the hedges are all level and equal in height.**  

From above, the tops look flat with well-trimmed corners.  

Here is a side view showing how the front is sculpted with the taller sections protruding just a bit.  
**It is looking very straight and square.**  

And here is the finished hedge – trimmed beautifully.  
I can’t believe how much these grow every year.  

Across the gravel road is the hornbeam hedge surrounding my formal white lily and hosta garden.  
Chhiring uses orange twine along the top of the hedge, so it can be trimmed straight.  

**Here, Chhiring uses a level to check that everything is perfectly even from one end to the other.**  

**Here is a view once it is pruned.**  
The dark green of the hornbeams look so nice in contrast to the lighter green of the lily foliage and hostas in the foreground.  

**At the side entrance leading to my berry bushes and rose garden**, I decided to create a more sculpted top, so this bit will remain untouched while it grows. **It will look so nice once we shape it.**  

And here’s the other side.  
**Look how lush this garden is --– I will be sure to share more photos once the lilies are blooming.**  
Next to be done is the long European hornbeam hedge that runs along the back of my Summer House and Winter House.  
**It’s a busy summer here at working farm –-- there’s always lots to do, but the gardens, allées, and groves are all looking so wonderful.**

* From:【[Maintaining My American Beech Tree Grove](https://www.themarthablog.com/2022/07/maintaining-my-american-beech-tree-grove.html)】

> **Note**  
> The following is copied and pasted.  

**It's so important to keep up with the maintenance and care of the many trees here at my Bedford, New York farm.**  
**My grove of American beech trees, Fagus grandifolia, is undergoing a soil treatment program to make sure they continue to thrive.**  

**As many of you know, I tour the grounds every day and keep track of what needs pruning, feeding, and mulching throughout the year.**  
Early last month, I noticed something wasn't quite right with my American beech trees.  
**The trees just didn't look as vibrant or as full.**  
**I also knew there was a relatively new beech leaf disease that is spreading rapidly through the Northeast killing both mature American beeches and saplings.**  
I called on True Nature tree and soil expert, Sebastian “Rocky” Camarillo, to take a look right away.  
**Rocky assessed the trees, took many soil samples for testing, and started a thorough feeding plan.**  
**Yesterday, Rocky came back to see how they were doing.**  

Here are some photos, enjoy.  

**This is my grove of American beech trees.**  
**This grove is located at the east end of my long Boxwood Allee not far from the carriage road leading to my hayfields.**  
**This photo was taken last fall when my American beech tree grove looked lush and healthy.**  

**This spring, I noticed the trees were getting bare.**  
**I was concerned they had gotten the beech leaf disease that’s been plaguing trees across the country.**  
**The disease, which was first spotted in northeastern Ohio, causes parts of leaves to turn leathery and branches to wither and then kill a tree within six to 10 years.**  
**I definitely needed to make sure these beautiful specimens survived.**  

**True Nature owner, Rocky Camarillo, came to the farm last month and noticed there was clearly something wrong.**  

**Rocky took many samples of soil from around the trees for testing.**  
**Soil helps regulate the water, supports biodiversity, filters pollutants, provides support, and cycles nutrients.**  
**Soil tests are available at garden shops and online.**  
**It is a good idea to test one’s garden soil every three to five years.**  

**And then he treated the roots around every tree in the grove.**  
**It is crucial to feed the roots and the soil in order to feed the trees.**  
Rocky used a solution containing nitrogen, iron, sulfur, magnesium, manganese, boron, and zinc and went all the way out just past the drip-line of every tree.  

**Unfortunately, the leaves looked withered and many had not grown.**  

**Held up to the sunlight, the leaves also showed dark bands --– a sign of the beech leaf disease.**  
**An invasive nematode is believed to be responsible for disease.**    
**These microscopic worms are present in the leaves and buds of infected beech trees.**  
**Hopefully the added nutrients could strengthen the tree and fight the disease.**  

**In the weeks following that first treatment, I already noticed a little improvement.**  
**Rocky returned to the farm yesterday to check on the grove.**  

**While many of the leaves still looked diseased, new growth showed green, smooth, healthy leaves.**  
**The trees were doing better, but the soil still needed some more nutrients.**  
The soil tests showed a low CEC, or Cation exchange capacity, a property of soil that describes its capacity to supply nutrients for plant uptake.  

Rocky’s son, Eric, puts together the AirSpade – a hose attachment for a compressor that can shoot air and uncover sensitive tree roots without harming them.  

**Using the AirSpade, Rocky clears the area around the tree’s base.**  
The trunk base, where it widens, is called the root flare or root collar or root crown.  
**This is a key area on any tree.**  
The rule of thumb when planting trees is to be sure the tree is “bare to the flare.”  

Rocky also cuts any roots that are wrapped too tightly against the flare roots.  

This tree now has a well-exposed flare.  

**Next, Rocky uses the AirSpade to make holes around the tree.**  
Rocky does this in many locations under the canopy and all the way out just past the drip-line of every tree.  
The drip-line is the area directly located under the outer circumference of the tree branches.  
When the tree canopy gets wet, any excess is shed to the ground along this drip-line.  
**This is also known as a tree’s critical root zone or root protection zone.**  

Meanwhile, Eric mixes a solution of compost and biochar, which is the lightweight black residue, made of carbon and ashes.  

**He then adds bokashi, a fermented organic fertilizer that contains beneficial microorganisms and nutrients.**  
**Bokashi is different from compost because it uses fermentation to break organic waste down and compost uses decomposition.**  

Here, Rocky mixes the elements together.  

**And then Freddy pushes generous amounts of the mixture into each hole around the tree.**  

**Each hole goes down at least a foot deep into the soil.**  

**The next step is to spray the surface soil with fertilizer.**  
The same liquid fertilizer he used in his first visit.  

**Freddy sprays the fertilizer generously around each tree.**  
**We’re also expecting some rain this week which will hopefully help the tree roots absorb the new nutrients.**  

**The trio stopped for a quick photo – here’s Rocky, Freddy, and Eric.**  

**Rocky will be back again before the summer is over to check on this grove and all the other American beech trees around the farm, including the purple columnar beech trees around my pool, the fastigiate beech trees outside my Winter House, and the weeping copper beech trees.**  
**I am looking forward to seeing these trees look even better in the weeks ahead.**  
**I will keep you all updated – stay tuned.**

* From:【[What's Flowering at Skylands](https://www.themarthablog.com/2022/07/whats-flowering-at-skylands-2.html)】

> **Note**  
> The following is copied and pasted.  


I hope you all had a lovely Independence Day weekend.  
**Here in the Northeast, we had excellent weather at my Bedford, New York farm and up at Skylands, my home in Maine, where there are many flowers now in bloom.**  

**I love Maine - for me, it is a magical place and I always wish I could spend more time there.**  
In May, I go up to carry out my annual task of planting the large ornamental urns and planters that adorn the exterior of my home.  
**And later during the summer I go up there again to spend a few weeks with family and friends.**  **Unfortunately, I don't always get to see all the beautiful flowers that blossom at Skylands, but Cheryl DuLong, who helps me care for Skylands, and Wendy Norling, one of my gardeners, keep me updated by sending photographs from time to time.**  

**Here's a look at what's been blooming over the last couple of weeks, enjoy.**  

**The garden in the center of my circular driveway at Skylands is so lush this time of year.**  
It is planted with hay-scented ferns, purple smoke bushes, and spruce trees, Picea orientalis ‘Skylands’.  
**When I found this variety**, I just had to get many to plant up here at MY Skylands.  

This columbine plant, Aquilegia, is blooming on the edge of the Council Circle where friends and family love to gather.  
Columbine is an easy-to-grow perennial that offers seasonal interest throughout the year.  
**Columbines aren’t particular about soil as long it’s well-draining and not too dry.**  
**It blooms in a variety of colors and forms, which emerge from its attractive dark green foliage.**  
**The bell-shaped flowers are also a favorite to hummingbirds and may be used in cut-flower arrangements as well.**  

**Here’s another columbine in dark purple and white.**  

**The woodland up near my lost pools is filled with beautiful moss.**  
**Mosses are small, non-vascular flowerless plants that typically form dense green clumps or mats, often in damp or shady locations.**  
**Moss is a slow growing wild plant that should never be harvested in large amounts --– in fact, it is illegal to take any moss from national forests without permission.**  
**Whenever we use moss, we are always very conscious to return it to the forest once the season is over, so it can regenerate and flourish.**  

**Calendula has daisy-like bright orange or yellow flowers and pale green leaves.**  
**Commonly called the pot marigold, Calendula officinalis, the calendula flower is historically used for medicinal and culinary purposes.**  
**Like most herbs, calendulas are adaptable and do not require a lot of maintenance.**  
**They can be grown in containers or in the garden bed with full sun to shade conditions.**  

**Both my herbaceous peonies and my tree peonies are finished blooming at Bedford, but they’re looking wonderful at Skylands.**  
The peony is any plant in the genus Paeonia, the only genus in the family Paeoniaceae.  

**Here is a gorgeous large white peony flower.**  
**Herbaceous peony blooms range from simple blossoms to complex clusters.**  

**Wendy captured this image of the Nicotiana --– a genus of herbaceous plants and shrubs of the family Solanaceae that is indigenous to the Americas, Australia, southwest Africa and the South Pacific.**

**Iris flowers bloom in shades of purple, blue, white and yellow and include many hybridized versions that are multi-colored.**  

**Also looking very vibrant right now is our Astilbes.**  
**Astilbes are wonderful shade perennials, known for their dark green foliage and plume-like blossoms.**  

**These lupine flowers are attractive and spiky, reaching one to four feet in height.**  
**Lupine flowers may be annual and last only for a season or perennial, returning for a few years in the same spot in which they were planted.**  
The lupine plant grows from a long taproot and loves full sun.  
**The flowers are produced in dense or open whorls on an erect spike, each flower about one to two centimeters long.**  
The pea-like flowers have an upper standard, or banner, two lateral wings, and two lower petals fused into a keel.  

**Alliums are also growing at Skylands.**  
Allium species are herbaceous perennials with flowers produced on scapes.  
**They grow from solitary or clustered bulbs and come in a broad palette of colors, heights, bloom times and flower forms.**  
**They will grow in most any soil, as long as it is well-drained.**  
**And they love sunlight and will perform best when planted in full sun.**  

**These little ferns are growing out of the side of the cliff walk.**  
**They’re called common rockcap ferns – a native evergreen fern found in moist rocky areas.**  

**Heliotrope is a plant of the borage family, cultivated for its fragrant purple or blue flowers, which are used in perfume.**  

**This is Mountain Laurel. This shade-tolerant North American shrub has beautiful flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer.**  
**A close relative of rhododendrons and azaleas, it’s a great option for shady gardens.**  
It’s also evergreen, so after the blooms have faded, its leathery deep green foliage continues to add beauty to any space.  

**On my large terrace, Cheryl took this photo of one of the agaves we planted just a few weeks ago.**  
**Agaves are exotic, deer-resistant, drought-tolerant, and make wonderful container plants.**  
**It’s not easy dealing with giant, prickly agave plants.**  
**One must be very careful of one’s eyes, face, and skin whenever planting them.**  

Clematis is a genus of about 300 species in the buttercup family Ranunculaceae.  
T**he name Clematis comes from the Greek word “klematis,” meaning vine.**  
**Clematis, pronounced KLEH-muh-tis, are native to China and Japan and known to be vigorous growers.**  

The hellebores are still going strong in Maine.  
I’ve had hellebores in my gardens for many years.  
Hellebores are members of the Eurasian genus Helleborus – about 20 species of evergreen perennial flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae.  
**They blossom during late winter and through spring for up to three months.**  
**Hellebores are widely grown for decorative purposes because they are easy-to-grow and are able to resist frost.**  
It is common to plant them on slopes or in raised beds in order to see their flowers, which tend to nod.  

These are the flowers of the golden chain tree at the little chapel at Skylands.  
Laburnum, sometimes called golden rain or golden chain, is a genus of two species of small trees in the subfamily Faboideae of the pea family Fabaceae.  
**It has golden-yellow flowers that grow 10 to 20 inches in length.**  
**but beware – all parts of the tree contain cytisine and are highly toxic to humans and pets.**  

And here’s a view that never gets tiring.  
**Taken through the woods, this view looks at Seal Harbor and Sutton’s Island in the distance.**  
**I can’t wait to return to Skylands for my next visit.**  
**Thanks for the photos, Wendy and Cheryl!**

* From:【[The First Dahlias of the Season](https://www.themarthablog.com/2022/07/the-first-dahlias-of-the-season.html)】

> **Note**  
> The following is copied and pasted.  

The dahlias are growing so nicely this season, and some are already beginning to show off those colorful flowers that bloom from midsummer right through the first frost.  

The dahlia garden is tucked behind my vegetable greenhouse in an area exposed to full sun and protected from strong winds.  
My dahlias are from Floret, a family farm and floral design studio in the State of Washington.  
We also have some from Swan Island Dahlias in Oregon, a family owned business and the largest and leading dahlia grower in the United States.  
And, a selection comes from The Flower Hat, based in Bozeman, Montana.  

Enjoy these photos of some of the season's first dahlia blooms and have a lovely July 4th weekend.  

**Dahlias grow more blooms when they get at least six to eight hours of direct sunlight per day.**  
**This spot was previously used for growing grapes, but it has now turned out to be a perfect place for our dahlias.**  

Dahlia plants have slender erect stems which are not always capable of holding up the large flowers, so they must be well-supported.  
This year we used bamboo stakes and jute twine.  
The twine is looped around the bamboo, so the flower stems can grow between the strands.  

**The array of flower colors, sizes, and shapes is astounding.**  
**Dahlias come in white, shades of pink, red, yellow, orange, shades of purple, and various combinations of these colors – every color but true blue.**  
Do you know… in the 19th century, a London newspaper offered a pound, or a little more than a dollar, to the first breeder to create a blue dahlia?  
Interestingly, the reward was never claimed, but there have been many attempts that are near-blue.  
**Like many flower varieties, there is also no pure black variety—only dark red and dark purple.**  

**Dahlias are named after 18th-century Swedish botanist Anders Dahl.**  
**He actually categorized dahlias as a vegetable because of their edible tubers.**  
**The tubers are said to taste like a mix between potatoes and radishes.**  

Dahlia plant leaves grow opposite each other and are simple to pinnately compound with segments that are ovate to oblong to lanceolate in shape.  
The leaf margins may be lobed or dentate.  
**Leaves may be green, reddish-purple, or purple-black depending on the variety.**  

**Currently, there are about 42 species of dahlia, with hybrids commonly grown as garden plants.**  
A member of the Asteraceae family of dicotyledonous plants, some of its relatives include the sunflower, daisy, chrysanthemum, and zinnia.  

This cactus variety is called ‘Park Princess’ with tightly rolled rich, vibrant pink petals.  
It is a prolific re-bloomer and an excellent cut flower.  

**Dahlias are classified according to flower shape and petal arrangement.**  

This is a single dahlia with just one row of petals surrounding the center disc.  
They range from a charming single, daisy-like flower to the popular double varieties which can be two-inch-pompons to 12-inch dinner plate size.  
They are divided into 10 groups:  
single, anemone, collarette, waterlily, decorative, fall, pompon, cactus, semi-cactus, and miscellaneous.  

Pompon dahlias yield masses of intricate, fully double blooms measuring up to two-and-a-half inches across.  
**This dahlia is a pretty light salmon color.**  

**Dahlias thrive in rich, well-drained soil with a pH level of 6.5 to 7.0 and slightly acidic.**  

**The majority of dahlia species do not produce scented flowers or cultivars, but they are brightly colored to attract pollinating insects.**  

**Dahlias are very attractive to bees and hummingbirds.**  

Here is an elegant dahlia which produces large blossoms with fully double, slender, deep pink petals with creamy throats that produce a frilled effect-hence the name Fimbriata meaning frilly.  

**The genus Dahlia is native to the high plains of Mexico.**  
Some species can be found in Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador & Costa Rica as well as parts of South America where it was introduced.  
**This lavender-pink dahlia also has frilled petals.**  

**This dahlia is creamy yellow with a bold yellow center – a lovely and perfectly formed bloom.**  

**And here is one in dark burgundy.**  

This dahlia is named ‘Bashful’ with its dark burgundy petals, hot pink tips, and golden stamens in the center of the flower.  
**The three-inch flower blooms on a plant that grows to two-and-a-half feet by the end of the season.**  
This is a great dahlia for bedding, containers, and cut flowers.  

Dahlias are herbaceous perennials, but often grown as annuals.  
**We used to dig up our dahlias at the end of the season and then replant them in the spring.**  
**The key to maintaining dahlia tubers for the winter is making sure they stay dry, have good air circulation, and are in a cool, dark spot.**  
This past winter, we covered them with bales of hay to protect them from the winter elements – and it worked.

This dahlia bud is just about to open.  
**When the flowers grow, they emerge small and pale green at first.**  
**And gradually they get larger and more detailed.**  

**Dahlias produce an abundance of wonderful flowers throughout early summer and again in late summer until the first frost.**  
**I am looking forward to many arrangements.**  

Many of you often These gorgeous flowers were used for a recent photo shoot.  
**The color combinations look so pretty in these glass vessels.**  
When arranging, always strip off all the leaves that would be below the water line in the vase.  
This is true for all flower arrangements, not just dahlias.  
**When leaves stay underwater, they decay and release bacteria that shorten the vase life of the flowers.**  
**And change the water daily so they look fresh and last longer.**  
**These dahlias should last through the holiday weekend.**

If you have some free time this weekend it’s never too early to start planning and prepping for the holiday season.

Recently on QVC, we celebrated "Christmas in July" with some of my newest decorations.  
I hope you were able to catch some of my appearances - I was on from early morning to late at night, joining LIVE right from my Bedford, New York farm talking with various hosts about my festive ornaments, figures, candles, tabletop trees, wines, and of course, the day's TSV - my Color Change Globe Light Strands.  
My entire home studio living room was lit up and filled with cheerful lights and pieces.  

Enjoy these photos, and be sure to take a look at all my holiday offerings on the QVC website.  

Here I am in my studio living room surrounded by lots of my newest holiday items for QVC.  
**We spent an entire day – 24-hours – celebrating my Collection. ** 
**It’s a lot of work, but always fun.**  

**Our tree looks so pretty this year.**  
**Look at all the glistening ornaments.**  
As part of my Collection, I am offering 13-piece Tree Decor Kits – complete with stars, wreaths, beaded birds, and metallic bursts.  
Buy one set, two, or even three and use them on your own tree or give away as gifts.  

Here is one of the beaded stars included in the kit.  

And here is one of the metallic bursts – they really do brighten up the tree and add a nice variety of decorations all in one group.  

This season, one can also get a set of six of these Metallic Feathered Birds with clips.  
As many of you know, I love birds, and these make such a nice addition to the holiday decor.  
**They come in silver or gold.**  

On my mantel are my Glittered Leaf Flower Lights.  
These lights come in six-foot long strands.  

**They can run for 266 hours and have a multi-function timer.**  

I decorated the mantel with my lights, flocked trees, and my popular flameless candles.  

This is my 16-inch Down Swept Flocked Tabletop Tree with 30 battery-operated LED lights.  
Place it on the mantel, bookcase, or table and decorate it with clip-on birds.

Everyone loves these Cable Knit Flameless Candle Pillars.  
**These are ivory, but they also come in Bedford gray and red.**

I also offer sets of two Glittered Holiday Tree Pillars in six-inch and nine-inch sizes.  
**These are white, but they also come in silver, champagne, and gold.**  
And they run on a multi-timer remote control.  

These birds come in a set of six and are made of blown glass on easy to use clips.  
**They look so pretty perching on your holiday tree branches.**  

Use my Jingle Bell Star Ornaments as part of your gift decor – attach to the bow and make them even more special.  

And the day’s TSV is my Color Change Globe Light Strands in silver or gold.  
I have them all over the room.

On my windowsill are these cheerful flat jeweled pedestal trees which can be swept up or down for display.  
And look, my TSV Color Change Globe Lights can be positioned around the base of the trees for a more festive effect.  

My TSV lights can also be mixed with holiday ornaments and placed in a cloche – look how festive they are.

**Drape the lights on your logs when the fireplace is not being used.**  
**It adds a beautiful look, especially at night.**  

This is one of a pair of Tinsel Fur Penguins.  
My Color Change Globe Lights look so fanciful used as a necklace.  

Place the pair on pedestals – a large one looks up as the other smaller penguin looks down.  

And don’t forget the wine.  
Order this for yourself or give as a gift.  
This wine set includes a choice of three 750-ml bottles of wine and three gift bags.  
The wine selections are Spencer Family Sauvignon Blanc, Bayshore Pinot Grigio, Monarch Glen Merlot, and Sierra Trails Zinfandel.  

And, because it’s “Christmas in July” – why not light up some beautiful summer roses?  
**Place them around the smaller vase containing the flowers, and then put in a larger glass vessel.** **These lights can be used in so many different ways in any season.**  
**We had so much fun talking about these holiday decorations.**  
**I hope you visit the website to see more of my new offerings.**  
It may be July now, but the holidays will be here before you know it.
