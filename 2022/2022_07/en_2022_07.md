The dahlias are growing so nicely this season, and some are already beginning to show off those colorful flowers that bloom from midsummer right through the first frost.  

The dahlia garden is tucked behind my vegetable greenhouse in an area exposed to full sun and protected from strong winds.  
My dahlias are from Floret, a family farm and floral design studio in the State of Washington.  
We also have some from Swan Island Dahlias in Oregon, a family owned business and the largest and leading dahlia grower in the United States.  
And, a selection comes from The Flower Hat, based in Bozeman, Montana.  

Enjoy these photos of some of the season's first dahlia blooms and have a lovely July 4th weekend.  

**Dahlias grow more blooms when they get at least six to eight hours of direct sunlight per day.**  
**This spot was previously used for growing grapes, but it has now turned out to be a perfect place for our dahlias.**  

Dahlia plants have slender erect stems which are not always capable of holding up the large flowers, so they must be well-supported.  
This year we used bamboo stakes and jute twine.  
The twine is looped around the bamboo, so the flower stems can grow between the strands.  

**The array of flower colors, sizes, and shapes is astounding.**  
**Dahlias come in white, shades of pink, red, yellow, orange, shades of purple, and various combinations of these colors – every color but true blue.**  
Do you know… in the 19th century, a London newspaper offered a pound, or a little more than a dollar, to the first breeder to create a blue dahlia?  
Interestingly, the reward was never claimed, but there have been many attempts that are near-blue.  
**Like many flower varieties, there is also no pure black variety—only dark red and dark purple.**  

**Dahlias are named after 18th-century Swedish botanist Anders Dahl.**  
**He actually categorized dahlias as a vegetable because of their edible tubers.**  
**The tubers are said to taste like a mix between potatoes and radishes.**  

Dahlia plant leaves grow opposite each other and are simple to pinnately compound with segments that are ovate to oblong to lanceolate in shape.  
The leaf margins may be lobed or dentate.  
**Leaves may be green, reddish-purple, or purple-black depending on the variety.**  

**Currently, there are about 42 species of dahlia, with hybrids commonly grown as garden plants.**  
A member of the Asteraceae family of dicotyledonous plants, some of its relatives include the sunflower, daisy, chrysanthemum, and zinnia.  

This cactus variety is called ‘Park Princess’ with tightly rolled rich, vibrant pink petals.  
It is a prolific re-bloomer and an excellent cut flower.  

**Dahlias are classified according to flower shape and petal arrangement.**  

This is a single dahlia with just one row of petals surrounding the center disc.  
They range from a charming single, daisy-like flower to the popular double varieties which can be two-inch-pompons to 12-inch dinner plate size.  
They are divided into 10 groups:  
single, anemone, collarette, waterlily, decorative, fall, pompon, cactus, semi-cactus, and miscellaneous.  

Pompon dahlias yield masses of intricate, fully double blooms measuring up to two-and-a-half inches across.  
**This dahlia is a pretty light salmon color.**  

**Dahlias thrive in rich, well-drained soil with a pH level of 6.5 to 7.0 and slightly acidic.**  

**The majority of dahlia species do not produce scented flowers or cultivars, but they are brightly colored to attract pollinating insects.**  

**Dahlias are very attractive to bees and hummingbirds.**  

Here is an elegant dahlia which produces large blossoms with fully double, slender, deep pink petals with creamy throats that produce a frilled effect-hence the name Fimbriata meaning frilly.  

**The genus Dahlia is native to the high plains of Mexico.**  
Some species can be found in Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador & Costa Rica as well as parts of South America where it was introduced.  
**This lavender-pink dahlia also has frilled petals.**  

**This dahlia is creamy yellow with a bold yellow center – a lovely and perfectly formed bloom.**  

**And here is one in dark burgundy.**  

This dahlia is named ‘Bashful’ with its dark burgundy petals, hot pink tips, and golden stamens in the center of the flower.  
**The three-inch flower blooms on a plant that grows to two-and-a-half feet by the end of the season.**  
This is a great dahlia for bedding, containers, and cut flowers.  

Dahlias are herbaceous perennials, but often grown as annuals.  
**We used to dig up our dahlias at the end of the season and then replant them in the spring.**  
**The key to maintaining dahlia tubers for the winter is making sure they stay dry, have good air circulation, and are in a cool, dark spot.**  
This past winter, we covered them with bales of hay to protect them from the winter elements – and it worked.

This dahlia bud is just about to open.  
**When the flowers grow, they emerge small and pale green at first.**  
**And gradually they get larger and more detailed.**  

**Dahlias produce an abundance of wonderful flowers throughout early summer and again in late summer until the first frost.**  
**I am looking forward to many arrangements.**  

Many of you often These gorgeous flowers were used for a recent photo shoot.  
**The color combinations look so pretty in these glass vessels.**  
When arranging, always strip off all the leaves that would be below the water line in the vase.  
This is true for all flower arrangements, not just dahlias.  
**When leaves stay underwater, they decay and release bacteria that shorten the vase life of the flowers.**  
**And change the water daily so they look fresh and last longer.**  
**These dahlias should last through the holiday weekend.**

If you have some free time this weekend it’s never too early to start planning and prepping for the holiday season.

Recently on QVC, we celebrated "Christmas in July" with some of my newest decorations.  
I hope you were able to catch some of my appearances - I was on from early morning to late at night, joining LIVE right from my Bedford, New York farm talking with various hosts about my festive ornaments, figures, candles, tabletop trees, wines, and of course, the day's TSV - my Color Change Globe Light Strands.  
My entire home studio living room was lit up and filled with cheerful lights and pieces.  

Enjoy these photos, and be sure to take a look at all my holiday offerings on the QVC website.  

Here I am in my studio living room surrounded by lots of my newest holiday items for QVC.  
**We spent an entire day – 24-hours – celebrating my Collection. ** 
**It’s a lot of work, but always fun.**  

**Our tree looks so pretty this year.**  
**Look at all the glistening ornaments.**  
As part of my Collection, I am offering 13-piece Tree Decor Kits – complete with stars, wreaths, beaded birds, and metallic bursts.  
Buy one set, two, or even three and use them on your own tree or give away as gifts.  

Here is one of the beaded stars included in the kit.  

And here is one of the metallic bursts – they really do brighten up the tree and add a nice variety of decorations all in one group.  

This season, one can also get a set of six of these Metallic Feathered Birds with clips.  
As many of you know, I love birds, and these make such a nice addition to the holiday decor.  
**They come in silver or gold.**  

On my mantel are my Glittered Leaf Flower Lights.  
These lights come in six-foot long strands.  

**They can run for 266 hours and have a multi-function timer.**  

I decorated the mantel with my lights, flocked trees, and my popular flameless candles.  

This is my 16-inch Down Swept Flocked Tabletop Tree with 30 battery-operated LED lights.  
Place it on the mantel, bookcase, or table and decorate it with clip-on birds.

Everyone loves these Cable Knit Flameless Candle Pillars.  
**These are ivory, but they also come in Bedford gray and red.**

I also offer sets of two Glittered Holiday Tree Pillars in six-inch and nine-inch sizes.  
**These are white, but they also come in silver, champagne, and gold.**  
And they run on a multi-timer remote control.  

These birds come in a set of six and are made of blown glass on easy to use clips.  
**They look so pretty perching on your holiday tree branches.**  

Use my Jingle Bell Star Ornaments as part of your gift decor – attach to the bow and make them even more special.  

And the day’s TSV is my Color Change Globe Light Strands in silver or gold.  
I have them all over the room.

On my windowsill are these cheerful flat jeweled pedestal trees which can be swept up or down for display.  
And look, my TSV Color Change Globe Lights can be positioned around the base of the trees for a more festive effect.  

My TSV lights can also be mixed with holiday ornaments and placed in a cloche – look how festive they are.

**Drape the lights on your logs when the fireplace is not being used.**  
**It adds a beautiful look, especially at night.**  

This is one of a pair of Tinsel Fur Penguins.  
My Color Change Globe Lights look so fanciful used as a necklace.  

Place the pair on pedestals – a large one looks up as the other smaller penguin looks down.  

And don’t forget the wine.  
Order this for yourself or give as a gift.  
This wine set includes a choice of three 750-ml bottles of wine and three gift bags.  
The wine selections are Spencer Family Sauvignon Blanc, Bayshore Pinot Grigio, Monarch Glen Merlot, and Sierra Trails Zinfandel.  

And, because it’s “Christmas in July” – why not light up some beautiful summer roses?  
**Place them around the smaller vase containing the flowers, and then put in a larger glass vessel.** **These lights can be used in so many different ways in any season.**  
**We had so much fun talking about these holiday decorations.**  
**I hope you visit the website to see more of my new offerings.**  
It may be July now, but the holidays will be here before you know it.
